001. 【标题】达尔沃 - 维基百科 --- DARVO - Wikipedia

002. DARVO (an acronym for "Deny, Attack, Reverse Victim and Offender") is a reaction that perpetrators of wrongdoing, such as abusers or sexual offenders, may display in response to being held accountable for their behavior.[1] Research indicates that it is a common manipulation strategy of psychological abusers.[2][3][4]DARVO（“否认、攻击、反向受害者和犯罪者”的首字母缩写词）是不当行为的肇事者（例如施虐者或性犯罪者）在对其行为负责时可能表现出的反应。[1] 研究表明，这是心理虐待者的常见纵策略。[2][3][4]

003. Process  过程

004. DARVO is a tactic used by a perpetrator to avoid accountability for their actions.[5] As the acronym suggests, DARVO commonly involves these steps:
DARVO 是肇事者用来逃避对其行为负责的一种策略。[5] 正如首字母缩略词所暗示的那样，DARVO 通常涉及以下步骤：

005. The perpetrator denies the harm or abuse ever took place.[6]肇事者否认曾经发生过伤害或虐待。[6]

006. When confronted with evidence, the perpetrator then attacks the person that they had harmed, or are still harming. The attacker may also attack the victim's family or friends.[7]当面对证据时，肇事者会攻击他们已经伤害或仍在伤害的人。攻击者还可能攻击受害者的家人或朋友。[7]

007. Finally, the perpetrator claims that they were or are actually the victim in the situation, thus reversing the positions of victim and offender.[2][4] It often involves not just playing the victim but also victim blaming.[3]最后，肇事者声称他们曾经或实际上是这种情况下的受害者，从而颠倒了受害者和犯罪者的立场。[2][4] 它通常不仅涉及扮演受害者， 还涉及指责受害者 。[3]

008. These tactics are similar to other techniques used by perpetrators to avoid accountability by manipulating observers' perceptions of events.[8][7] Researchers have noted similarities to outrage management, where a perpetrator tries to make observers think better of themself and their actions so they can avoid consequences.[9] This strategy often involves denying the victim's version of events and trying to make observers doubt the victim's credibility, which are both key aspects of DARVO. Relevant techniques also include playing the victim and playing the hero, which perpetrators use to downplay the harm seen in their behavior. In playing the victim, a perpetrator highlights their own past suffering to attempt to be seen as a victim as well, and in playing the hero, a perpetrator admits to some amount of wrongdoing but highlights their own past good deeds to mitigate their harmful ones. Both techniques may come into play for the denying or reversing stages of DARVO.[10]这些策略类似于肇事者通过纵观察者对事件的看法来逃避责任的其他技术。[8] [7] 研究人员注意到与愤怒管理的相似之处，在愤怒管理中，肇事者试图让观察者更好地看待自己和他们的行为，以便他们能够避免后果。[9] 这种策略通常涉及否认受害者对事件的说法，并试图让观察者怀疑受害者的可信度，这都是 DARVO 的关键方面。相关技术还包括扮演受害者和扮演英雄 ，肇事者用这些技术来淡化他们行为中看到的伤害。在扮演受害者时，肇事者强调自己过去的痛苦，试图也被视为受害者，而在扮演英雄时，肇事者承认有一定程度的错误行为，但强调自己过去的善行，以减轻他们的伤害。这两种技术都可能在 DARVO 的拒绝或逆转阶段发挥作用。[10]

009. Origins  起源

010. The acronym and theory behind DARVO is based on the work of psychologist Jennifer Freyd, who wrote about it in 1997.[2] The first stage of DARVO, denial, involves gaslighting.[3][4] Freyd writes:
DARVO 背后的首字母缩略词和理论基于心理学家 Jennifer Freyd 的工作，她在 1997 年撰写了有关它的文章。[2]DARVO 的第一阶段，否认，涉及煤气灯纵 。[3] [4] 弗雷德写道：

011. ... I have observed that actual abusers threaten, bully and make a nightmare for anyone who holds them accountable or asks them to change their abusive behavior. This attack, intended to chill and terrify, typically includes threats of law suits, overt and covert attacks on the whistle-blower's credibility, and so on. The attack will often take the form of focusing on ridiculing the person who attempts to hold the offender accountable. [...] [T]he offender rapidly creates the impression that the abuser is the wronged one, while the victim or concerned observer is the offender. Figure and ground are completely reversed. [...] The offender is on the offense and the person attempting to hold the offender accountable is put on the defense.[2]...我观察到，真正的施虐者会威胁、欺凌，并为任何追究他们责任或要求他们改变虐待行为的人做噩梦。这种攻击旨在令人寒心和恐惧，通常包括法律诉讼威胁、对举报人信誉的公开和秘密攻击等等。攻击通常采取的是侧重于嘲笑试图追究罪犯责任的人。   [...]犯罪者很快就会给人留下这样的印象，即施虐者是受委屈的人，而受害者或相关观察者是犯罪者。图形和接地完全相反。   [...]罪犯处于进攻状态，试图追究罪犯责任的人则处于辩护状态。[2]

012. Research on interpersonal violence has mostly focused on how perpetrators use individual components or steps of DARVO, rather than studying them in combination.[11] However, studies before and after DARVO was coined found a correlation between perpetrators who minimized or denied their wrongdoing and those who reversed the positions of victim and offender. Research during the 2010s began to focus on the use and effect of DARVO tactics in combination, suggesting that DARVO is a common tactic used by perpetrators.[10]对人际暴力的研究主要集中在肇事者如何使用 DARVO 的各个组成部分或步骤，而不是将它们组合起来研究。[11] 然而，DARVO 诞生前后的研究发现，最小化或否认其不当行为的肇事者与颠倒受害者和犯罪者立场的肇事者之间存在相关性。2010 年代的研究开始关注 DARVO 策略组合的使用和效果，这表明 DARVO 是犯罪者常用的策略。[10]
Usage  用法[edit]
Studies on the prevalence of DARVO suggest it is a common tactic used by perpetrators when they are confronted over their behavior, regardless of the type of harm they have caused. One study of undergraduates who had confronted someone over a harmful event found that DARVO was used by 72% of the perpetrators during the confrontation. The offenses ranged from social mistreatment, like betrayed secrets, to interpersonal violence, like sexual assault or child abuse. DARVO is particularly likely in cases of sexual violence, with one study of women who had been sexually assaulted at university reporting that half of the perpetrators involved had used elements of DARVO in later conversations.[12]对 DARVO 患病率的研究表明，这是肇事者在面对自己的行为时使用的常用策略，无论他们造成的伤害类型如何。一项针对因有害事件与某人对峙的本科生的研究发现，72% 的肇事者在对抗期间使用了 DARVO。这些罪行的范围从社会虐待（如背叛秘密）到人际暴力（如性侵犯或虐待儿童）。DARVO 在性暴力案件中尤其可能发生，一项针对在大学遭受性侵犯的女性的研究报告称，一半的肇事者在后来的对话中使用了 DARVO 的元素。[12]
DARVO has been studied and documented in specific contexts beyond those of interpersonal violence. DARVO has been labeled in some cases of medical malpractice, where victim blaming is already common since doctors and hospitals generally refuse to admit their mistakes due to legal risk.[13] DARVO has also been cited as common in workplace bullying and toxic workplace culture. In the case of academia, when professors try to report bullying, DARVO tactics often compel them to stop speaking up, adding to their trauma and contributing to a culture of silence.[14][15]DARVO 在人际暴力之外的特定背景下进行了研究和记录。DARVO 在一些医疗事故案件中被贴上了标签，在这些案件中，指责受害者已经很常见，因为医生和医院通常出于法律风险拒绝承认自己的错误。[13]DARVO 也被认为是工作场所欺凌和有毒工作场所文化中的常见现象。就学术界而言，当教授试图举报欺凌行为时，DARVO 策略通常会迫使他们停止发声，从而增加他们的创伤并助长沉默文化。[14] [15]
In this vein, DARVO has been theorized as acting on groups of people and not just individuals. One case under study was the intense backlash to the MeToo movement, where men's rights activists cast MeToo allegations as false and claimed the assailants were the real victims via a reactionary hashtag, #HimToo.[16] Other researchers say DARVO can happen at even wider societal levels, labeling it as DARVO when media organizations promote rape myths in efforts to discredit sexual assault victims.[17] Researchers have also drawn parallels between individual DARVO tactics and the tendency for dominant cultural groups to stigmatize and blame groups who are speaking up about their trauma.[18]本着这种精神，DARVO 被理论化为作用于人群而不仅仅是个人。正在研究的一个案例是对 MeToo 运动的强烈反对， 男权活动人士将 MeToo 指控视为虚假，并通过反动标签声称袭击者是真正的受害者，#HimToo。[16] 其他研究人员表示，DARVO 可能发生在更广泛的社会层面，当媒体组织宣传强奸神话以诋毁性侵犯受害者时，将其标记为 DARVO。[17] 研究人员还将个人 DARVO 策略与主导文化群体污名化和指责那些直言不讳的创伤群体的倾向进行了比较。[18]

Effectiveness  有效性[edit]
DARVO tactics are more successful when abusers can take advantage of societal beliefs and stereotypes to convince their audience of their new narrative. In the case of sexual violence, assailants sometimes victim-blame by appealing to societal opinions on gender roles and power dynamics. Stereotypes can help perpetrators: if an assailant is a white wealthy man, he may be perceived as authoritative and sincere, whereas if an accusation against him was made by a journalist, they might be seen as predatory and thus less trustworthy. Stereotypes can also limit the effectiveness or opportunity for DARVO tactics: one example is how the ethnic stereotype of Black men as dangerous predators makes it harder for assailants who are Black men to employ DARVO.[19] Similarly, gender stereotypes about sexual violence help explain why DARVO in assault cases grows more effective where a woman has assaulted a man, rather than vice versa.[20]当施虐者可以利用社会信仰和刻板印象来说服他们的受众接受他们的新叙述时，DARVO 策略会更加成功。在性暴力的情况下，袭击者有时会通过诉诸社会对性别角色和权力动态的看法来指责受害者 。刻板印象可以帮助肇事者：如果袭击者是白人富人，他可能会被认为是权威和真诚的，而如果记者对他的指控是记者提出的，他们可能会被视为掠夺性，因此不太值得信任。刻板印象也会限制 DARVO 策略的有效性或机会：一个例子是，黑人男性作为危险掠夺者的种族刻板印象如何使黑人袭击者更难使用 DARVO。[19] 同样，关于性暴力的性别刻板印象有助于解释为什么 DARVO 在女性侵犯男性的情况下在袭击案件中变得更加有效，而不是相反。[20]
DARVO is able to move perceptions of responsibility and blame from attackers to victims, when studied in cases of sexual abuse. One study found that DARVO made observers see perpetrators as less responsible for a described case of abuse and less abusive in general, than in cases where DARVO was not used. Victims were likewise seen as more responsible for the abuse against them, and more abusive. The study also found that DARVO reduces the believability of victims and perpetrators when it is used. Even though both sides are seen as less credible by observers, this still hurts victims more: they often need to meet a high standard of credibility to be taken seriously or to successfully report or litigate cases of sexual violence.[20]在对性虐待案件进行研究时，DARVO 能够将责任和责备的感知从攻击者转移到受害者身上。一项研究发现，与未使用 DARVO 的案件相比，DARVO 使观察者认为肇事者对所描述的虐待案件的责任较小，总体上虐待行为也较少。受害者同样被认为对他们的虐待负有更大的责任，而且虐待行为也更多。研究还发现，使用 DARVO 会降低受害者和肇事者的可信度。尽管观察家认为双方都不太可信，但这仍然对受害者造成更大的伤害：他们通常需要达到高标准的可信度才能得到认真对待，或者成功报告或提起性暴力案件。[20]
Knowledge of DARVO makes observers less likely to be manipulated by it. In the previous study, the negative effects of DARVO were lessened for observers who had previously learned about how DARVO works. This made observers less likely to blame the victim or decide the victim should be punished, and more likely to agree that the perpetrator should be punished.[20]了解 DARVO 使观察者不太可能被它纵。在之前的研究中，对于之前了解过 DARVO 工作原理的观察者来说，DARVO 的负面影响有所减轻。这使得观察者不太可能责怪受害者或决定应该惩罚受害者，而更有可能同意肇事者应该受到惩罚。[20]

Vulnerable settings  易受攻击的设置[edit]
DARVO is a particular concern in legal contexts and institutional reporting systems, because perpetrators engaging in DARVO tactics frequently use these systems against their victims. Judicial systems often treat alleged perpetrators and victims neutrally during investigations, so an alleged perpetrator and victim have similar legal processes and may have the same access to supportive or protective measures.[21]DARVO 在法律背景和机构报告系统中是一个特别令人担忧的问题，因为从事 DARVO 策略的肇事者经常使用这些系统来对付受害者。司法系统在调查过程中通常以中立的态度对待被指控的肇事者和受害者，因此被指控的肇事者和受害者有相似的法律程序，并且可能有同样的机会获得支持或保护措施。[21]
In American universities, where Title IX offices often handle investigations of sexual assault and harassment, limited protective measures are available before a full investigation is completed. Assailants engaging in DARVO use these protective measures against their victims, taking advantage of the neutral policies of the office and the attempts of administrators to support the rights of both the accuser and accused.[21]在美国大学中，Title IX 办公室经常处理性侵犯和性骚扰的调查，在全面调查完成之前，可用的保护措施有限。参与 DARVO 的袭击者利用该办公室的中立政策和管理人员支持原告和被告权利的努力，对受害者采取这些保护措施。[21]
DARVO manifests in the legal system when assailants file lawsuits against their victims, and these commonly take the form of defamation or libel cases where assailants accuse their accusers of trying to hurt their reputations.[19] Legal DARVO tactics had been growing more common as of 2022.[21] After this rise, many U.S. states passed anti-SLAPP laws to help victims dismiss certain DARVO-based defamation lawsuits. Anti-SLAPP measures help in cases where a perpetrator's lawsuit would obviously fail and was just brought forward to increase public and financial pressure on the victim.[22]当袭击者对受害者提起诉讼时，DARVO 就会体现在法律体系中，这些诉讼通常采取诽谤或诽谤案件的形式，袭击者指责指控他们的指控者试图损害他们的声誉。[19] 截至 2022 年，合法的 DARVO 策略变得越来越普遍。[21] 在这一上升之后，美国许多州通过了反 SLAPP 法律，以帮助受害者驳回某些基于 DARVO 的诽谤诉讼。反 SLAPP 措施有助于在肇事者的诉讼显然失败的情况下提供帮助，而只是为了增加受害者的公共和经济压力而提出的。[22]

Motivations and beliefs  动机和信念[edit]
Researchers have examined how the beliefs of abusive partners match what is claimed in DARVO tactics, where perpetrators deny abuse happened and blame the victim for being the aggressor. In one study concerning intimate partner violence among college students, researchers asked students to fill out private surveys that measured internalized beliefs about their relationships and allowed students to self-report intimate partner violence they had committed. Researchers found a strong correlation between students of all genders who had previously abused their partners and the belief that relationship difficulties were their partner's fault, and not their own. For male respondents, avoiding the discussion of relationship difficulties was also strongly correlated with the likelihood of past abuse. Other research has found that violent men are more likely than nonviolent men to believe their partners are critical and intentionally malicious.[23] Studies of abusive men have also found that they frequently minimize or fully deny that incidents of abuse happened, and that this behavior is most common when the abusers fear legal issues or other situational consequences.[24]研究人员研究了施虐伴侣的信念如何与 DARVO 策略中声称的相匹配，在 DARVO 策略中，肇事者否认发生过虐待并将受害者归咎于施暴者。在一项关于大学生亲密伴侣暴力的研究中，研究人员要求学生填写私人调查，衡量对他们关系的内化信念，并允许学生自我报告他们所犯下的亲密伴侣暴力。研究人员发现，以前虐待过伴侣的所有性别的学生与认为关系困难是伴侣的错而不是他们自己的错之间存在很强的相关性。对于男性受访者来说，避免讨论人际关系困难也与过去遭受虐待的可能性密切相关。其他研究发现，暴力男性比非暴力男性更有可能相信他们的伴侣是挑剔的和故意恶意的。[23] 对施虐男性的研究还发现，他们经常最小化或完全否认虐待事件的发生，当施虐者担心法律问题或其他情境后果时，这种行为最为常见。[24]
Because of DARVO's prevalence in cases of sexual harassment and violence, one study examined how someone's belief in rape myths intersected with their likelihood to use DARVO. The study measured participant's use of DARVO in reaction to the worst wrong they had ever been accused of committing, and found that DARVO reactions to any type of wrongdoing were correlated with greater acceptance of rape myths and likelihood of perpetrating sexual harassment. The authors propose a few potential explanations: people who use DARVO may be more accepting of victim blaming, people who minimize violence may minimize their own wrongdoing and feel righteously enabled to use DARVO, or persistent sexual harassers may have learned over time that DARVO allows them to avoid accountability.[25]
DARVO tactics are also associated with victims blaming themselves more for their abuse, with one explanation being that perpetrators' victim blaming gets internalized by the victims over time.[17] In one study of undergraduates who had confronted someone over a past wrongdoing, exposure to DARVO was strongly related to a confronter's self-blame regardless of the number of apology-related phrases they heard during a confrontation. This study also found that exposure to DARVO was related to the confrontation feeling like it was going poorly, and an increased number of negative emotions for the confronter.[3]
There has been some work specifically checking the relationship between DARVO and gender. The previous study of undergraduate confrontations did not establish who was the perpetrator or victim, but at least found correlations between confronting and accused parties and DARVO. It found that women were more likely to be exposed to DARVO tactics in all forms, including denial and minimization, personal attacks, victim blaming, and reversal of the role of perpetrator and victim. Men and women were equally likely to use DARVO in this study, although previous studies found that male perpetrators were more likely to use aspects of DARVO when it concerned their romantic relationships.[3] Another study found that DARVO in cases of sexual assault had a stronger impact when there was a male victim and female perpetrator, rather than a female victim and male perpetrator.[20]

In the case of academia, when professors try to report bullying, DARVO tactics often compel them to stop speaking up, adding to their trauma and contributing to a culture of silence.[14][15]DARVO 在人际暴力之外的特定背景下进行了研究和记录。DARVO 在一些医疗事故案件中被贴上了标签，在这些案件中，指责受害者已经很常见，因为医生和医院通常出于法律风险拒绝承认自己的错误。[13]DARVO 也被认为是工作场所欺凌和有毒工作场所文化中的常见现象。就学术界而言，当教授试图举报欺凌行为时，DARVO 策略通常会迫使他们停止发声，从而增加他们的创伤并助长沉默文化。[14] [15]
In this vein, DARVO has been theorized as acting on groups of people and not just individuals. One case under study was the intense backlash to the MeToo movement, where men's rights activists cast MeToo allegations as false and claimed the assailants were the real victims via a reactionary hashtag, #HimToo.[16] Other researchers say DARVO can happen at even wider societal levels, labeling it as DARVO when media organizations promote rape myths in efforts to discredit sexual assault victims.[17] Researchers have also drawn parallels between individual DARVO tactics and the tendency for dominant cultural groups to stigmatize and blame groups who are speaking up about their trauma.[18]本着这种精神，DARVO 被理论化为作用于人群而不仅仅是个人。正在研究的一个案例是对 MeToo 运动的强烈反对， 男权活动人士将 MeToo 指控视为虚假，并通过反动标签声称袭击者是真正的受害者，#HimToo。[16] 其他研究人员表示，DARVO 可能发生在更广泛的社会层面，当媒体组织宣传强奸神话以诋毁性侵犯受害者时，将其标记为 DARVO。[17] 研究人员还将个人 DARVO 策略与主导文化群体污名化和指责那些直言不讳的创伤群体的倾向进行了比较。[18]

Effectiveness  有效性[edit]
DARVO tactics are more successful when abusers can take advantage of societal beliefs and stereotypes to convince their audience of their new narrative. In the case of sexual violence, assailants sometimes victim-blame by appealing to societal opinions on gender roles and power dynamics. Stereotypes can help perpetrators: if an assailant is a white wealthy man, he may be perceived as authoritative and sincere, whereas if an accusation against him was made by a journalist, they might be seen as predatory and thus less trustworthy. Stereotypes can also limit the effectiveness or opportunity for DARVO tactics: one example is how the ethnic stereotype of Black men as dangerous predators makes it harder for assailants who are Black men to employ DARVO.[19] Similarly, gender stereotypes about sexual violence help explain why DARVO in assault cases grows more effective where a woman has assaulted a man, rather than vice versa.[20]当施虐者可以利用社会信仰和刻板印象来说服他们的受众接受他们的新叙述时，DARVO 策略会更加成功。在性暴力的情况下，袭击者有时会通过诉诸社会对性别角色和权力动态的看法来指责受害者 。刻板印象可以帮助肇事者：如果袭击者是白人富人，他可能会被认为是权威和真诚的，而如果记者对他的指控是记者提出的，他们可能会被视为掠夺性，因此不太值得信任。刻板印象也会限制 DARVO 策略的有效性或机会：一个例子是，黑人男性作为危险掠夺者的种族刻板印象如何使黑人袭击者更难使用 DARVO。[19] 同样，关于性暴力的性别刻板印象有助于解释为什么 DARVO 在女性侵犯男性的情况下在袭击案件中变得更加有效，而不是相反。[20]
DARVO is able to move perceptions of responsibility and blame from attackers to victims, when studied in cases of sexual abuse. One study found that DARVO made observers see perpetrators as less responsible for a described case of abuse and less abusive in general, than in cases where DARVO was not used. Victims were likewise seen as more responsible for the abuse against them, and more abusive. The study also found that DARVO reduces the believability of victims and perpetrators when it is used. Even though both sides are seen as less credible by observers, this still hurts victims more: they often need to meet a high standard of credibility to be taken seriously or to successfully report or litigate cases of sexual violence.[20]在对性虐待案件进行研究时，DARVO 能够将责任和责备的感知从攻击者转移到受害者身上。一项研究发现，与未使用 DARVO 的案件相比，DARVO 使观察者认为肇事者对所描述的虐待案件的责任较小，总体上虐待行为也较少。受害者同样被认为对他们的虐待负有更大的责任，而且虐待行为也更多。研究还发现，使用 DARVO 会降低受害者和肇事者的可信度。尽管观察家认为双方都不太可信，但这仍然对受害者造成更大的伤害：他们通常需要达到高标准的可信度才能得到认真对待，或者成功报告或提起性暴力案件。[20]
Knowledge of DARVO makes observers less likely to be manipulated by it. In the previous study, the negative effects of DARVO were lessened for observers who had previously learned about how DARVO works. This made observers less likely to blame the victim or decide the victim should be punished, and more likely to agree that the perpetrator should be punished.[20]了解 DARVO 使观察者不太可能被它纵。在之前的研究中，对于之前了解过 DARVO 工作原理的观察者来说，DARVO 的负面影响有所减轻。这使得观察者不太可能责怪受害者或决定应该惩罚受害者，而更有可能同意肇事者应该受到惩罚。[20]

Vulnerable settings  易受攻击的设置[edit]
DARVO is a particular concern in legal contexts and institutional reporting systems, because perpetrators engaging in DARVO tactics frequently use these systems against their victims. Judicial systems often treat alleged perpetrators and victims neutrally during investigations, so an alleged perpetrator and victim have similar legal processes and may have the same access to supportive or protective measures.[21]DARVO 在法律背景和机构报告系统中是一个特别令人担忧的问题，因为从事 DARVO 策略的肇事者经常使用这些系统来对付受害者。司法系统在调查过程中通常以中立的态度对待被指控的肇事者和受害者，因此被指控的肇事者和受害者有相似的法律程序，并且可能有同样的机会获得支持或保护措施。[21]
In American universities, where Title IX offices often handle investigations of sexual assault and harassment, limited protective measures are available before a full investigation is completed. Assailants engaging in DARVO use these protective measures against their victims, taking advantage of the neutral policies of the office and the attempts of administrators to support the rights of both the accuser and accused.[21]在美国大学中，Title IX 办公室经常处理性侵犯和性骚扰的调查，在全面调查完成之前，可用的保护措施有限。参与 DARVO 的袭击者利用该办公室的中立政策和管理人员支持原告和被告权利的努力，对受害者采取这些保护措施。[21]
DARVO manifests in the legal system when assailants file lawsuits against their victims, and these commonly take the form of defamation or libel cases where assailants accuse their accusers of trying to hurt their reputations.[19] Legal DARVO tactics had been growing more common as of 2022.[21] After this rise, many U.S. states passed anti-SLAPP laws to help victims dismiss certain DARVO-based defamation lawsuits. Anti-SLAPP measures help in cases where a perpetrator's lawsuit would obviously fail and was just brought forward to increase public and financial pressure on the victim.[22]当袭击者对受害者提起诉讼时，DARVO 就会体现在法律体系中，这些诉讼通常采取诽谤或诽谤案件的形式，袭击者指责指控他们的指控者试图损害他们的声誉。[19] 截至 2022 年，合法的 DARVO 策略变得越来越普遍。[21] 在这一上升之后，美国许多州通过了反 SLAPP 法律，以帮助受害者驳回某些基于 DARVO 的诽谤诉讼。反 SLAPP 措施有助于在肇事者的诉讼显然失败的情况下提供帮助，而只是为了增加受害者的公共和经济压力而提出的。[22]

Motivations and beliefs  动机和信念[edit]
Researchers have examined how the beliefs of abusive partners match what is claimed in DARVO tactics, where perpetrators deny abuse happened and blame the victim for being the aggressor. In one study concerning intimate partner violence among college students, researchers asked students to fill out private surveys that measured internalized beliefs about their relationships and allowed students to self-report intimate partner violence they had committed. Researchers found a strong correlation between students of all genders who had previously abused their partners and the belief that relationship difficulties were their partner's fault, and not their own. For male respondents, avoiding the discussion of relationship difficulties was also strongly correlated with the likelihood of past abuse. Other research has found that violent men are more likely than nonviolent men to believe their partners are critical and intentionally malicious.[23] Studies of abusive men have also found that they frequently minimize or fully deny that incidents of abuse happened, and that this behavior is most common when the abusers fear legal issues or other situational consequences.[24]研究人员研究了施虐伴侣的信念如何与 DARVO 策略中声称的相匹配，在 DARVO 策略中，肇事者否认发生过虐待并将受害者归咎于施暴者。在一项关于大学生亲密伴侣暴力的研究中，研究人员要求学生填写私人调查，衡量对他们关系的内化信念，并允许学生自我报告他们所犯下的亲密伴侣暴力。研究人员发现，以前虐待过伴侣的所有性别的学生与认为关系困难是伴侣的错而不是他们自己的错之间存在很强的相关性。对于男性受访者来说，避免讨论人际关系困难也与过去遭受虐待的可能性密切相关。其他研究发现，暴力男性比非暴力男性更有可能相信他们的伴侣是挑剔的和故意恶意的。[23] 对施虐男性的研究还发现，他们经常最小化或完全否认虐待事件的发生，当施虐者担心法律问题或其他情境后果时，这种行为最为常见。[24]
Because of DARVO's prevalence in cases of sexual harassment and violence, one study examined how someone's belief in rape myths intersected with their likelihood to use DARVO. The study measured participant's use of DARVO in reaction to the worst wrong they had ever been accused of committing, and found that DARVO reactions to any type of wrongdoing were correlated with greater acceptance of rape myths and likelihood of perpetrating sexual harassment. The authors propose a few potential explanations: people who use DARVO may be more accepting of victim blaming, people who minimize violence may minimize their own wrongdoing and feel righteously enabled to use DARVO, or persistent sexual harassers may have learned over time that DARVO allows them to avoid accountability.[25]
DARVO tactics are also associated with victims blaming themselves more for their abuse, with one explanation being that perpetrators' victim blaming gets internalized by the victims over time.[17] In one study of undergraduates who had confronted someone over a past wrongdoing, exposure to DARVO was strongly related to a confronter's self-blame regardless of the number of apology-related phrases they heard during a confrontation. This study also found that exposure to DARVO was related to the confrontation feeling like it was going poorly, and an increased number of negative emotions for the confronter.[3]
There has been some work specifically checking the relationship between DARVO and gender. The previous study of undergraduate confrontations did not establish who was the perpetrator or victim, but at least found correlations between confronting and accused parties and DARVO. It found that women were more likely to be exposed to DARVO tactics in all forms, including denial and minimization, personal attacks, victim blaming, and reversal of the role of perpetrator and victim. Men and women were equally likely to use DARVO in this study, although previous studies found that male perpetrators were more likely to use aspects of DARVO when it concerned their romantic relationships.[3] Another study found that DARVO in cases of sexual assault had a stronger impact when there was a male victim and female perpetrator, rather than a female victim and male perpetrator.[20]

015. DARVO has been studied and documented in specific contexts beyond those of interpersonal violence. DARVO has been labeled in some cases of medical malpractice, where victim blaming is already common since doctors and hospitals generally refuse to admit their mistakes due to legal risk.[13] DARVO has also been cited as common in workplace bullying and toxic workplace culture. In the case of academia, when professors try to report bullying, DARVO tactics often compel them to stop speaking up, adding to their trauma and contributing to a culture of silence.[14][15]DARVO 在人际暴力之外的特定背景下进行了研究和记录。DARVO 在一些医疗事故案件中被贴上了标签，在这些案件中，指责受害者已经很常见，因为医生和医院通常出于法律风险拒绝承认自己的错误。[13]DARVO 也被认为是工作场所欺凌和有毒工作场所文化中的常见现象。就学术界而言，当教授试图举报欺凌行为时，DARVO 策略通常会迫使他们停止发声，从而增加他们的创伤并助长沉默文化。[14] [15]
In this vein, DARVO has been theorized as acting on groups of people and not just individuals. One case under study was the intense backlash to the MeToo movement, where men's rights activists cast MeToo allegations as false and claimed the assailants were the real victims via a reactionary hashtag, #HimToo.[16] Other researchers say DARVO can happen at even wider societal levels, labeling it as DARVO when media organizations promote rape myths in efforts to discredit sexual assault victims.[17] Researchers have also drawn parallels between individual DARVO tactics and the tendency for dominant cultural groups to stigmatize and blame groups who are speaking up about their trauma.[18]本着这种精神，DARVO 被理论化为作用于人群而不仅仅是个人。正在研究的一个案例是对 MeToo 运动的强烈反对， 男权活动人士将 MeToo 指控视为虚假，并通过反动标签声称袭击者是真正的受害者，#HimToo。[16] 其他研究人员表示，DARVO 可能发生在更广泛的社会层面，当媒体组织宣传强奸神话以诋毁性侵犯受害者时，将其标记为 DARVO。[17] 研究人员还将个人 DARVO 策略与主导文化群体污名化和指责那些直言不讳的创伤群体的倾向进行了比较。[18]

Effectiveness  有效性[edit]
DARVO tactics are more successful when abusers can take advantage of societal beliefs and stereotypes to convince their audience of their new narrative. In the case of sexual violence, assailants sometimes victim-blame by appealing to societal opinions on gender roles and power dynamics. Stereotypes can help perpetrators: if an assailant is a white wealthy man, he may be perceived as authoritative and sincere, whereas if an accusation against him was made by a journalist, they might be seen as predatory and thus less trustworthy. Stereotypes can also limit the effectiveness or opportunity for DARVO tactics: one example is how the ethnic stereotype of Black men as dangerous predators makes it harder for assailants who are Black men to employ DARVO.[19] Similarly, gender stereotypes about sexual violence help explain why DARVO in assault cases grows more effective where a woman has assaulted a man, rather than vice versa.[20]当施虐者可以利用社会信仰和刻板印象来说服他们的受众接受他们的新叙述时，DARVO 策略会更加成功。在性暴力的情况下，袭击者有时会通过诉诸社会对性别角色和权力动态的看法来指责受害者 。刻板印象可以帮助肇事者：如果袭击者是白人富人，他可能会被认为是权威和真诚的，而如果记者对他的指控是记者提出的，他们可能会被视为掠夺性，因此不太值得信任。刻板印象也会限制 DARVO 策略的有效性或机会：一个例子是，黑人男性作为危险掠夺者的种族刻板印象如何使黑人袭击者更难使用 DARVO。[19] 同样，关于性暴力的性别刻板印象有助于解释为什么 DARVO 在女性侵犯男性的情况下在袭击案件中变得更加有效，而不是相反。[20]
DARVO is able to move perceptions of responsibility and blame from attackers to victims, when studied in cases of sexual abuse. One study found that DARVO made observers see perpetrators as less responsible for a described case of abuse and less abusive in general, than in cases where DARVO was not used. Victims were likewise seen as more responsible for the abuse against them, and more abusive. The study also found that DARVO reduces the believability of victims and perpetrators when it is used. Even though both sides are seen as less credible by observers, this still hurts victims more: they often need to meet a high standard of credibility to be taken seriously or to successfully report or litigate cases of sexual violence.[20]在对性虐待案件进行研究时，DARVO 能够将责任和责备的感知从攻击者转移到受害者身上。一项研究发现，与未使用 DARVO 的案件相比，DARVO 使观察者认为肇事者对所描述的虐待案件的责任较小，总体上虐待行为也较少。受害者同样被认为对他们的虐待负有更大的责任，而且虐待行为也更多。研究还发现，使用 DARVO 会降低受害者和肇事者的可信度。尽管观察家认为双方都不太可信，但这仍然对受害者造成更大的伤害：他们通常需要达到高标准的可信度才能得到认真对待，或者成功报告或提起性暴力案件。[20]
Knowledge of DARVO makes observers less likely to be manipulated by it. In the previous study, the negative effects of DARVO were lessened for observers who had previously learned about how DARVO works. This made observers less likely to blame the victim or decide the victim should be punished, and more likely to agree that the perpetrator should be punished.[20]了解 DARVO 使观察者不太可能被它纵。在之前的研究中，对于之前了解过 DARVO 工作原理的观察者来说，DARVO 的负面影响有所减轻。这使得观察者不太可能责怪受害者或决定应该惩罚受害者，而更有可能同意肇事者应该受到惩罚。[20]

Other research has found that violent men are more likely than nonviolent men to believe their partners are critical and intentionally malicious.[23] Studies of abusive men have also found that they frequently minimize or fully deny that incidents of abuse happened, and that this behavior is most common when the abusers fear legal issues or other situational consequences.[24]研究人员研究了施虐伴侣的信念如何与 DARVO 策略中声称的相匹配，在 DARVO 策略中，肇事者否认发生过虐待并将受害者归咎于施暴者。在一项关于大学生亲密伴侣暴力的研究中，研究人员要求学生填写私人调查，衡量对他们关系的内化信念，并允许学生自我报告他们所犯下的亲密伴侣暴力。研究人员发现，以前虐待过伴侣的所有性别的学生与认为关系困难是伴侣的错而不是他们自己的错之间存在很强的相关性。对于男性受访者来说，避免讨论人际关系困难也与过去遭受虐待的可能性密切相关。其他研究发现，暴力男性比非暴力男性更有可能相信他们的伴侣是挑剔的和故意恶意的。[23] 对施虐男性的研究还发现，他们经常最小化或完全否认虐待事件的发生，当施虐者担心法律问题或其他情境后果时，这种行为最为常见。[24]
Because of DARVO's prevalence in cases of sexual harassment and violence, one study examined how someone's belief in rape myths intersected with their likelihood to use DARVO. The study measured participant's use of DARVO in reaction to the worst wrong they had ever been accused of committing, and found that DARVO reactions to any type of wrongdoing were correlated with greater acceptance of rape myths and likelihood of perpetrating sexual harassment. The authors propose a few potential explanations: people who use DARVO may be more accepting of victim blaming, people who minimize violence may minimize their own wrongdoing and feel righteously enabled to use DARVO, or persistent sexual harassers may have learned over time that DARVO allows them to avoid accountability.[25]
DARVO tactics are also associated with victims blaming themselves more for their abuse, with one explanation being that perpetrators' victim blaming gets internalized by the victims over time.[17] In one study of undergraduates who had confronted someone over a past wrongdoing, exposure to DARVO was strongly related to a confronter's self-blame regardless of the number of apology-related phrases they heard during a confrontation. This study also found that exposure to DARVO was related to the confrontation feeling like it was going poorly, and an increased number of negative emotions for the confronter.[3]
There has been some work specifically checking the relationship between DARVO and gender. The previous study of undergraduate confrontations did not establish who was the perpetrator or victim, but at least found correlations between confronting and accused parties and DARVO. It found that women were more likely to be exposed to DARVO tactics in all forms, including denial and minimization, personal attacks, victim blaming, and reversal of the role of perpetrator and victim. Men and women were equally likely to use DARVO in this study, although previous studies found that male perpetrators were more likely to use aspects of DARVO when it concerned their romantic relationships.[3] Another study found that DARVO in cases of sexual assault had a stronger impact when there was a male victim and female perpetrator, rather than a female victim and male perpetrator.[20]

016. In this vein, DARVO has been theorized as acting on groups of people and not just individuals. One case under study was the intense backlash to the MeToo movement, where men's rights activists cast MeToo allegations as false and claimed the assailants were the real victims via a reactionary hashtag, #HimToo.[16] Other researchers say DARVO can happen at even wider societal levels, labeling it as DARVO when media organizations promote rape myths in efforts to discredit sexual assault victims.[17] Researchers have also drawn parallels between individual DARVO tactics and the tendency for dominant cultural groups to stigmatize and blame groups who are speaking up about their trauma.[18]本着这种精神，DARVO 被理论化为作用于人群而不仅仅是个人。正在研究的一个案例是对 MeToo 运动的强烈反对， 男权活动人士将 MeToo 指控视为虚假，并通过反动标签声称袭击者是真正的受害者，#HimToo。[16] 其他研究人员表示，DARVO 可能发生在更广泛的社会层面，当媒体组织宣传强奸神话以诋毁性侵犯受害者时，将其标记为 DARVO。[17] 研究人员还将个人 DARVO 策略与主导文化群体污名化和指责那些直言不讳的创伤群体的倾向进行了比较。[18]

017. Effectiveness  有效性

018. DARVO tactics are more successful when abusers can take advantage of societal beliefs and stereotypes to convince their audience of their new narrative. In the case of sexual violence, assailants sometimes victim-blame by appealing to societal opinions on gender roles and power dynamics. Stereotypes can help perpetrators: if an assailant is a white wealthy man, he may be perceived as authoritative and sincere, whereas if an accusation against him was made by a journalist, they might be seen as predatory and thus less trustworthy. Stereotypes can also limit the effectiveness or opportunity for DARVO tactics: one example is how the ethnic stereotype of Black men as dangerous predators makes it harder for assailants who are Black men to employ DARVO.[19] Similarly, gender stereotypes about sexual violence help explain why DARVO in assault cases grows more effective where a woman has assaulted a man, rather than vice versa.[20]当施虐者可以利用社会信仰和刻板印象来说服他们的受众接受他们的新叙述时，DARVO 策略会更加成功。在性暴力的情况下，袭击者有时会通过诉诸社会对性别角色和权力动态的看法来指责受害者 。刻板印象可以帮助肇事者：如果袭击者是白人富人，他可能会被认为是权威和真诚的，而如果记者对他的指控是记者提出的，他们可能会被视为掠夺性，因此不太值得信任。刻板印象也会限制 DARVO 策略的有效性或机会：一个例子是，黑人男性作为危险掠夺者的种族刻板印象如何使黑人袭击者更难使用 DARVO。[19] 同样，关于性暴力的性别刻板印象有助于解释为什么 DARVO 在女性侵犯男性的情况下在袭击案件中变得更加有效，而不是相反。[20]
DARVO is able to move perceptions of responsibility and blame from attackers to victims, when studied in cases of sexual abuse. One study found that DARVO made observers see perpetrators as less responsible for a described case of abuse and less abusive in general, than in cases where DARVO was not used. Victims were likewise seen as more responsible for the abuse against them, and more abusive. The study also found that DARVO reduces the believability of victims and perpetrators when it is used. Even though both sides are seen as less credible by observers, this still hurts victims more: they often need to meet a high standard of credibility to be taken seriously or to successfully report or litigate cases of sexual violence.[20]在对性虐待案件进行研究时，DARVO 能够将责任和责备的感知从攻击者转移到受害者身上。一项研究发现，与未使用 DARVO 的案件相比，DARVO 使观察者认为肇事者对所描述的虐待案件的责任较小，总体上虐待行为也较少。受害者同样被认为对他们的虐待负有更大的责任，而且虐待行为也更多。研究还发现，使用 DARVO 会降低受害者和肇事者的可信度。尽管观察家认为双方都不太可信，但这仍然对受害者造成更大的伤害：他们通常需要达到高标准的可信度才能得到认真对待，或者成功报告或提起性暴力案件。[20]
Knowledge of DARVO makes observers less likely to be manipulated by it. In the previous study, the negative effects of DARVO were lessened for observers who had previously learned about how DARVO works. This made observers less likely to blame the victim or decide the victim should be punished, and more likely to agree that the perpetrator should be punished.[20]了解 DARVO 使观察者不太可能被它纵。在之前的研究中，对于之前了解过 DARVO 工作原理的观察者来说，DARVO 的负面影响有所减轻。这使得观察者不太可能责怪受害者或决定应该惩罚受害者，而更有可能同意肇事者应该受到惩罚。[20]

Vulnerable settings  易受攻击的设置[edit]
DARVO is a particular concern in legal contexts and institutional reporting systems, because perpetrators engaging in DARVO tactics frequently use these systems against their victims. Judicial systems often treat alleged perpetrators and victims neutrally during investigations, so an alleged perpetrator and victim have similar legal processes and may have the same access to supportive or protective measures.[21]DARVO 在法律背景和机构报告系统中是一个特别令人担忧的问题，因为从事 DARVO 策略的肇事者经常使用这些系统来对付受害者。司法系统在调查过程中通常以中立的态度对待被指控的肇事者和受害者，因此被指控的肇事者和受害者有相似的法律程序，并且可能有同样的机会获得支持或保护措施。[21]
In American universities, where Title IX offices often handle investigations of sexual assault and harassment, limited protective measures are available before a full investigation is completed. Assailants engaging in DARVO use these protective measures against their victims, taking advantage of the neutral policies of the office and the attempts of administrators to support the rights of both the accuser and accused.[21]在美国大学中，Title IX 办公室经常处理性侵犯和性骚扰的调查，在全面调查完成之前，可用的保护措施有限。参与 DARVO 的袭击者利用该办公室的中立政策和管理人员支持原告和被告权利的努力，对受害者采取这些保护措施。[21]
DARVO manifests in the legal system when assailants file lawsuits against their victims, and these commonly take the form of defamation or libel cases where assailants accuse their accusers of trying to hurt their reputations.[19] Legal DARVO tactics had been growing more common as of 2022.[21] After this rise, many U.S. states passed anti-SLAPP laws to help victims dismiss certain DARVO-based defamation lawsuits. Anti-SLAPP measures help in cases where a perpetrator's lawsuit would obviously fail and was just brought forward to increase public and financial pressure on the victim.[22]当袭击者对受害者提起诉讼时，DARVO 就会体现在法律体系中，这些诉讼通常采取诽谤或诽谤案件的形式，袭击者指责指控他们的指控者试图损害他们的声誉。[19] 截至 2022 年，合法的 DARVO 策略变得越来越普遍。[21] 在这一上升之后，美国许多州通过了反 SLAPP 法律，以帮助受害者驳回某些基于 DARVO 的诽谤诉讼。反 SLAPP 措施有助于在肇事者的诉讼显然失败的情况下提供帮助，而只是为了增加受害者的公共和经济压力而提出的。[22]

Motivations and beliefs  动机和信念[edit]
Researchers have examined how the beliefs of abusive partners match what is claimed in DARVO tactics, where perpetrators deny abuse happened and blame the victim for being the aggressor. In one study concerning intimate partner violence among college students, researchers asked students to fill out private surveys that measured internalized beliefs about their relationships and allowed students to self-report intimate partner violence they had committed. Researchers found a strong correlation between students of all genders who had previously abused their partners and the belief that relationship difficulties were their partner's fault, and not their own. For male respondents, avoiding the discussion of relationship difficulties was also strongly correlated with the likelihood of past abuse. Other research has found that violent men are more likely than nonviolent men to believe their partners are critical and intentionally malicious.[23] Studies of abusive men have also found that they frequently minimize or fully deny that incidents of abuse happened, and that this behavior is most common when the abusers fear legal issues or other situational consequences.[24]研究人员研究了施虐伴侣的信念如何与 DARVO 策略中声称的相匹配，在 DARVO 策略中，肇事者否认发生过虐待并将受害者归咎于施暴者。在一项关于大学生亲密伴侣暴力的研究中，研究人员要求学生填写私人调查，衡量对他们关系的内化信念，并允许学生自我报告他们所犯下的亲密伴侣暴力。研究人员发现，以前虐待过伴侣的所有性别的学生与认为关系困难是伴侣的错而不是他们自己的错之间存在很强的相关性。对于男性受访者来说，避免讨论人际关系困难也与过去遭受虐待的可能性密切相关。其他研究发现，暴力男性比非暴力男性更有可能相信他们的伴侣是挑剔的和故意恶意的。[23] 对施虐男性的研究还发现，他们经常最小化或完全否认虐待事件的发生，当施虐者担心法律问题或其他情境后果时，这种行为最为常见。[24]

019. DARVO is able to move perceptions of responsibility and blame from attackers to victims, when studied in cases of sexual abuse. One study found that DARVO made observers see perpetrators as less responsible for a described case of abuse and less abusive in general, than in cases where DARVO was not used. Victims were likewise seen as more responsible for the abuse against them, and more abusive. The study also found that DARVO reduces the believability of victims and perpetrators when it is used. Even though both sides are seen as less credible by observers, this still hurts victims more: they often need to meet a high standard of credibility to be taken seriously or to successfully report or litigate cases of sexual violence.[20]在对性虐待案件进行研究时，DARVO 能够将责任和责备的感知从攻击者转移到受害者身上。一项研究发现，与未使用 DARVO 的案件相比，DARVO 使观察者认为肇事者对所描述的虐待案件的责任较小，总体上虐待行为也较少。受害者同样被认为对他们的虐待负有更大的责任，而且虐待行为也更多。研究还发现，使用 DARVO 会降低受害者和肇事者的可信度。尽管观察家认为双方都不太可信，但这仍然对受害者造成更大的伤害：他们通常需要达到高标准的可信度才能得到认真对待，或者成功报告或提起性暴力案件。[20]
Knowledge of DARVO makes observers less likely to be manipulated by it. In the previous study, the negative effects of DARVO were lessened for observers who had previously learned about how DARVO works. This made observers less likely to blame the victim or decide the victim should be punished, and more likely to agree that the perpetrator should be punished.[20]了解 DARVO 使观察者不太可能被它纵。在之前的研究中，对于之前了解过 DARVO 工作原理的观察者来说，DARVO 的负面影响有所减轻。这使得观察者不太可能责怪受害者或决定应该惩罚受害者，而更有可能同意肇事者应该受到惩罚。[20]

Vulnerable settings  易受攻击的设置[edit]
DARVO is a particular concern in legal contexts and institutional reporting systems, because perpetrators engaging in DARVO tactics frequently use these systems against their victims. Judicial systems often treat alleged perpetrators and victims neutrally during investigations, so an alleged perpetrator and victim have similar legal processes and may have the same access to supportive or protective measures.[21]DARVO 在法律背景和机构报告系统中是一个特别令人担忧的问题，因为从事 DARVO 策略的肇事者经常使用这些系统来对付受害者。司法系统在调查过程中通常以中立的态度对待被指控的肇事者和受害者，因此被指控的肇事者和受害者有相似的法律程序，并且可能有同样的机会获得支持或保护措施。[21]
In American universities, where Title IX offices often handle investigations of sexual assault and harassment, limited protective measures are available before a full investigation is completed. Assailants engaging in DARVO use these protective measures against their victims, taking advantage of the neutral policies of the office and the attempts of administrators to support the rights of both the accuser and accused.[21]在美国大学中，Title IX 办公室经常处理性侵犯和性骚扰的调查，在全面调查完成之前，可用的保护措施有限。参与 DARVO 的袭击者利用该办公室的中立政策和管理人员支持原告和被告权利的努力，对受害者采取这些保护措施。[21]
DARVO manifests in the legal system when assailants file lawsuits against their victims, and these commonly take the form of defamation or libel cases where assailants accuse their accusers of trying to hurt their reputations.[19] Legal DARVO tactics had been growing more common as of 2022.[21] After this rise, many U.S. states passed anti-SLAPP laws to help victims dismiss certain DARVO-based defamation lawsuits. Anti-SLAPP measures help in cases where a perpetrator's lawsuit would obviously fail and was just brought forward to increase public and financial pressure on the victim.[22]当袭击者对受害者提起诉讼时，DARVO 就会体现在法律体系中，这些诉讼通常采取诽谤或诽谤案件的形式，袭击者指责指控他们的指控者试图损害他们的声誉。[19] 截至 2022 年，合法的 DARVO 策略变得越来越普遍。[21] 在这一上升之后，美国许多州通过了反 SLAPP 法律，以帮助受害者驳回某些基于 DARVO 的诽谤诉讼。反 SLAPP 措施有助于在肇事者的诉讼显然失败的情况下提供帮助，而只是为了增加受害者的公共和经济压力而提出的。[22]

Motivations and beliefs  动机和信念[edit]
Researchers have examined how the beliefs of abusive partners match what is claimed in DARVO tactics, where perpetrators deny abuse happened and blame the victim for being the aggressor. In one study concerning intimate partner violence among college students, researchers asked students to fill out private surveys that measured internalized beliefs about their relationships and allowed students to self-report intimate partner violence they had committed. Researchers found a strong correlation between students of all genders who had previously abused their partners and the belief that relationship difficulties were their partner's fault, and not their own. For male respondents, avoiding the discussion of relationship difficulties was also strongly correlated with the likelihood of past abuse. Other research has found that violent men are more likely than nonviolent men to believe their partners are critical and intentionally malicious.[23] Studies of abusive men have also found that they frequently minimize or fully deny that incidents of abuse happened, and that this behavior is most common when the abusers fear legal issues or other situational consequences.[24]研究人员研究了施虐伴侣的信念如何与 DARVO 策略中声称的相匹配，在 DARVO 策略中，肇事者否认发生过虐待并将受害者归咎于施暴者。在一项关于大学生亲密伴侣暴力的研究中，研究人员要求学生填写私人调查，衡量对他们关系的内化信念，并允许学生自我报告他们所犯下的亲密伴侣暴力。研究人员发现，以前虐待过伴侣的所有性别的学生与认为关系困难是伴侣的错而不是他们自己的错之间存在很强的相关性。对于男性受访者来说，避免讨论人际关系困难也与过去遭受虐待的可能性密切相关。其他研究发现，暴力男性比非暴力男性更有可能相信他们的伴侣是挑剔的和故意恶意的。[23] 对施虐男性的研究还发现，他们经常最小化或完全否认虐待事件的发生，当施虐者担心法律问题或其他情境后果时，这种行为最为常见。[24]
Because of DARVO's prevalence in cases of sexual harassment and violence, one study examined how someone's belief in rape myths intersected with their likelihood to use DARVO. The study measured participant's use of DARVO in reaction to the worst wrong they had ever been accused of committing, and found that DARVO reactions to any type of wrongdoing were correlated with greater acceptance of rape myths and likelihood of perpetrating sexual harassment. The authors propose a few potential explanations: people who use DARVO may be more accepting of victim blaming, people who minimize violence may minimize their own wrongdoing and feel righteously enabled to use DARVO, or persistent sexual harassers may have learned over time that DARVO allows them to avoid accountability.[25]
DARVO tactics are also associated with victims blaming themselves more for their abuse, with one explanation being that perpetrators' victim blaming gets internalized by the victims over time.[17] In one study of undergraduates who had confronted someone over a past wrongdoing, exposure to DARVO was strongly related to a confronter's self-blame regardless of the number of apology-related phrases they heard during a confrontation. This study also found that exposure to DARVO was related to the confrontation feeling like it was going poorly, and an increased number of negative emotions for the confronter.[3]
There has been some work specifically checking the relationship between DARVO and gender. The previous study of undergraduate confrontations did not establish who was the perpetrator or victim, but at least found correlations between confronting and accused parties and DARVO. It found that women were more likely to be exposed to DARVO tactics in all forms, including denial and minimization, personal attacks, victim blaming, and reversal of the role of perpetrator and victim. Men and women were equally likely to use DARVO in this study, although previous studies found that male perpetrators were more likely to use aspects of DARVO when it concerned their romantic relationships.[3] Another study found that DARVO in cases of sexual assault had a stronger impact when there was a male victim and female perpetrator, rather than a female victim and male perpetrator.[20]

023. In American universities, where Title IX offices often handle investigations of sexual assault and harassment, limited protective measures are available before a full investigation is completed. Assailants engaging in DARVO use these protective measures against their victims, taking advantage of the neutral policies of the office and the attempts of administrators to support the rights of both the accuser and accused.[21]在美国大学中，Title IX 办公室经常处理性侵犯和性骚扰的调查，在全面调查完成之前，可用的保护措施有限。参与 DARVO 的袭击者利用该办公室的中立政策和管理人员支持原告和被告权利的努力，对受害者采取这些保护措施。[21]
DARVO manifests in the legal system when assailants file lawsuits against their victims, and these commonly take the form of defamation or libel cases where assailants accuse their accusers of trying to hurt their reputations.[19] Legal DARVO tactics had been growing more common as of 2022.[21] After this rise, many U.S. states passed anti-SLAPP laws to help victims dismiss certain DARVO-based defamation lawsuits. Anti-SLAPP measures help in cases where a perpetrator's lawsuit would obviously fail and was just brought forward to increase public and financial pressure on the victim.[22]当袭击者对受害者提起诉讼时，DARVO 就会体现在法律体系中，这些诉讼通常采取诽谤或诽谤案件的形式，袭击者指责指控他们的指控者试图损害他们的声誉。[19] 截至 2022 年，合法的 DARVO 策略变得越来越普遍。[21] 在这一上升之后，美国许多州通过了反 SLAPP 法律，以帮助受害者驳回某些基于 DARVO 的诽谤诉讼。反 SLAPP 措施有助于在肇事者的诉讼显然失败的情况下提供帮助，而只是为了增加受害者的公共和经济压力而提出的。[22]

Motivations and beliefs  动机和信念[edit]
Researchers have examined how the beliefs of abusive partners match what is claimed in DARVO tactics, where perpetrators deny abuse happened and blame the victim for being the aggressor. In one study concerning intimate partner violence among college students, researchers asked students to fill out private surveys that measured internalized beliefs about their relationships and allowed students to self-report intimate partner violence they had committed. Researchers found a strong correlation between students of all genders who had previously abused their partners and the belief that relationship difficulties were their partner's fault, and not their own. For male respondents, avoiding the discussion of relationship difficulties was also strongly correlated with the likelihood of past abuse. Other research has found that violent men are more likely than nonviolent men to believe their partners are critical and intentionally malicious.[23] Studies of abusive men have also found that they frequently minimize or fully deny that incidents of abuse happened, and that this behavior is most common when the abusers fear legal issues or other situational consequences.[24]研究人员研究了施虐伴侣的信念如何与 DARVO 策略中声称的相匹配，在 DARVO 策略中，肇事者否认发生过虐待并将受害者归咎于施暴者。在一项关于大学生亲密伴侣暴力的研究中，研究人员要求学生填写私人调查，衡量对他们关系的内化信念，并允许学生自我报告他们所犯下的亲密伴侣暴力。研究人员发现，以前虐待过伴侣的所有性别的学生与认为关系困难是伴侣的错而不是他们自己的错之间存在很强的相关性。对于男性受访者来说，避免讨论人际关系困难也与过去遭受虐待的可能性密切相关。其他研究发现，暴力男性比非暴力男性更有可能相信他们的伴侣是挑剔的和故意恶意的。[23] 对施虐男性的研究还发现，他们经常最小化或完全否认虐待事件的发生，当施虐者担心法律问题或其他情境后果时，这种行为最为常见。[24]
Because of DARVO's prevalence in cases of sexual harassment and violence, one study examined how someone's belief in rape myths intersected with their likelihood to use DARVO. The study measured participant's use of DARVO in reaction to the worst wrong they had ever been accused of committing, and found that DARVO reactions to any type of wrongdoing were correlated with greater acceptance of rape myths and likelihood of perpetrating sexual harassment. The authors propose a few potential explanations: people who use DARVO may be more accepting of victim blaming, people who minimize violence may minimize their own wrongdoing and feel righteously enabled to use DARVO, or persistent sexual harassers may have learned over time that DARVO allows them to avoid accountability.[25]
DARVO tactics are also associated with victims blaming themselves more for their abuse, with one explanation being that perpetrators' victim blaming gets internalized by the victims over time.[17] In one study of undergraduates who had confronted someone over a past wrongdoing, exposure to DARVO was strongly related to a confronter's self-blame regardless of the number of apology-related phrases they heard during a confrontation. This study also found that exposure to DARVO was related to the confrontation feeling like it was going poorly, and an increased number of negative emotions for the confronter.[3]
There has been some work specifically checking the relationship between DARVO and gender. The previous study of undergraduate confrontations did not establish who was the perpetrator or victim, but at least found correlations between confronting and accused parties and DARVO. It found that women were more likely to be exposed to DARVO tactics in all forms, including denial and minimization, personal attacks, victim blaming, and reversal of the role of perpetrator and victim. Men and women were equally likely to use DARVO in this study, although previous studies found that male perpetrators were more likely to use aspects of DARVO when it concerned their romantic relationships.[3] Another study found that DARVO in cases of sexual assault had a stronger impact when there was a male victim and female perpetrator, rather than a female victim and male perpetrator.[20]

DARVO tactics are also associated with victims blaming themselves more for their abuse, with one explanation being that perpetrators' victim blaming gets internalized by the victims over time.[17] In one study of undergraduates who had confronted someone over a past wrongdoing, exposure to DARVO was strongly related to a confronter's self-blame regardless of the number of apology-related phrases they heard during a confrontation. This study also found that exposure to DARVO was related to the confrontation feeling like it was going poorly, and an increased number of negative emotions for the confronter.[3]
There has been some work specifically checking the relationship between DARVO and gender. The previous study of undergraduate confrontations did not establish who was the perpetrator or victim, but at least found correlations between confronting and accused parties and DARVO. It found that women were more likely to be exposed to DARVO tactics in all forms, including denial and minimization, personal attacks, victim blaming, and reversal of the role of perpetrator and victim. Men and women were equally likely to use DARVO in this study, although previous studies found that male perpetrators were more likely to use aspects of DARVO when it concerned their romantic relationships.[3] Another study found that DARVO in cases of sexual assault had a stronger impact when there was a male victim and female perpetrator, rather than a female victim and male perpetrator.[20]

001. 【标题】习得性失助 - 维基百科，自由的百科全书

002. 习得性失助（英语：Learned helplessness），正统名称为习得无助，又称习得性无助、习得无助感、无助学习等，是指受试者在反复忍受令人厌恶的刺激后表现出的行为。[1][2][3]在人类的心理机制中，习得性无助与自我效能的概念有关，即个人对其实现目标的信念。习得性无助理论认为临床抑郁症和相关的精神疾病，可能是由于对情况结果失望以及自己无法控制结果所造成的。[4]

003. 人类会透过了解事物间的因果关系以及行为对周围造成的影响，从而学会如何适应环境。但假若一旦我们发觉这种因果关系不再存在，便会立刻觉得自己的所作所为没有意义，因为所作所为不能达到自己预期的效果。这种情况会引起一种不良的心理状态，称为“习得性无助”。
在诸多造成习得无助感的成因当中，最显而易见、可预测的是大环境的改变，如战争、饥荒、旱灾都会造成一个人出现习得无助感。例如心理学家曾研究二次大战犹太人大屠杀时的集中营幸存者，发现他们开始拒绝关心和鼓励自己。现代社会中容易造成习得无助感的环境有：精神病院、孤儿院或是安宁疗养机构。当人类得到习得无助感时，他们通常会从三个角度来思考问题，也就是：

个人（personal）：他们也许会认为自己就是问题的一部分，即“这是我的错” 。
渗透（pervasive）：他们也许会认为问题影响了生活中每个层面。
永恒（permanent）：他们也许会认为问题是不可能解决的。
上述这三点看问题的角度，通常被称为“3 Ps”，这三个论点同时也让其他人帮助具有习得无助感的人们走出自己的心理困境。不过有的时候，当面临巨大的危机时，人类也有可能自动走出习得无助感的枷锁。在小说《歌门鬼城》中的主角泰特斯·格兰（Titus Groan）原先是一位消极处世的贵族，但当家园有难，就马上转变成积极学习应战的态度，当危机解除，则又回来原先消极处世的情境。然而，小说主角的心理状况是否能作为现实中的普及案例有待查证。

来源[编辑]
习得无助感的理论，最早是在1975年由美国宾州大学心理系教授马丁·赛里格曼完成[5][6]。他使用了三只狗与鞍具行为来作为习得无助感的试验。第一只狗简单地被加上鞍具，随后被解下。第二只狗被加上鞍具之后，接受短暂但有痛感的电击，狗可以经由碰触杠杆来停止电击。第三只狗与第二只狗并排，并也接受同样的电击测试，它前面也有杠杆，唯一不同的是杠杆没有停止电击的作用。
在实验结束后，第一只与第二只狗都迅速地恢复原先的状态，但第三只狗则被诊断出有临床慢性消沉症状，也就是忧郁症[5]。
另外一个较小规模的试验是将两组狗放在吊床当中，第一组狗被轻微电流电击，但它们能够停止电流，另一组则不行，当这个吊床实验完结后，再将这两组狗放到一个有障碍物的屋子，第一组狗在屋子中遭受电击时，会跳过障碍物逃走，第二组狗在遭受电击时，则不尝试逃走，只会躺在原地不动。此即为习得无助感，尽管狗看到第一组的逃走范例，也知道自己能逃走，但他们并没有尝试。在其他实验当中，还用了不同的动物，结果都非常相似。在所有试验中，造成习得无助感最主要的原因，是心理上认为自己无法控制某件事情，进而产生消极的行为。
此外，也有与人相关的实验，例如，一个人坐在一间有噪音的小房间里，他如果找到可停止噪音的开关，并能关掉噪音的来源，这个试验者的心理状况就能够加强。这种意识到自己可改变周遭环境的心理状态，就是与习得无助感相比的对照。

对抗方法[编辑]
习惯性乐观，应用相同的逻辑，赛里格曼也研究人们如何免疫失败的感觉。采用不同的认知修正[7]，人们可以更有效应对沮丧或一些自己不能控制的情况。例如，家暴的受害者[8]、年老病人的不同问题[9]。

011. 另外一个较小规模的试验是将两组狗放在吊床当中，第一组狗被轻微电流电击，但它们能够停止电流，另一组则不行，当这个吊床实验完结后，再将这两组狗放到一个有障碍物的屋子，第一组狗在屋子中遭受电击时，会跳过障碍物逃走，第二组狗在遭受电击时，则不尝试逃走，只会躺在原地不动。此即为习得无助感，尽管狗看到第一组的逃走范例，也知道自己能逃走，但他们并没有尝试。在其他实验当中，还用了不同的动物，结果都非常相似。在所有试验中，造成习得无助感最主要的原因，是心理上认为自己无法控制某件事情，进而产生消极的行为。
此外，也有与人相关的实验，例如，一个人坐在一间有噪音的小房间里，他如果找到可停止噪音的开关，并能关掉噪音的来源，这个试验者的心理状况就能够加强。这种意识到自己可改变周遭环境的心理状态，就是与习得无助感相比的对照。

001. 【标题】创伤性结合 - 维基百科 --- Traumatic bonding - Wikipedia

002. Trauma bonds (also referred to as traumatic bonds) are emotional bonds that arise from a cyclical pattern of abuse. A trauma bond occurs in an abusive relationship, wherein the victim forms an emotional bond with the perpetrator.[1] The concept was developed by psychologists Donald Dutton and Susan Painter.[2][3][4]创伤纽带 （也称为创伤纽带 ）是由周期性虐待模式产生的情感纽带 。创伤纽带发生在虐待关系中，其中受害者与肇事者形成情感纽带。[1] 这个概念是由心理学家唐纳德·达顿和苏珊·佩因特提出的。[2][3][4]
The two main factors that contribute to the establishment of a trauma bond are a power imbalance and intermittent reward and punishment.[2][1][5] Trauma bonding can occur within romantic relationships, platonic friendships, parent-child relationships, incestuous relationships, cults, hostage situations, sex trafficking (especially that of minors), hazing or tours of duty among military personnel.[2][6]促成创伤纽带建立的两个主要因素是权力失衡和间歇性奖惩。[2] [1] [5] 创伤纽带可能发生在浪漫关系、柏拉图式友谊、亲子关系、 关系 、 邪教 、 人质事件、 易 （尤其是未成年人的易）、 欺凌或军事人员的执行任务中。[2][6]
Trauma bonds are based on terror, dominance, and unpredictability. As the trauma bond between an abuser and a victim strengthens, it can lead to cyclical patterns of conflicting emotions. Frequently, victims in trauma bonds do not have agency, autonomy, or an individual sense of self. Their self-image is an internalization of the abuser's conceptualization of them.[7]创伤纽带基于恐怖、支配和不可预测性。随着施虐者和受害者之间的创伤纽带加强，它可能导致情绪冲突的周期性模式。通常，创伤债券中的受害者没有能动性、自主权或个人自我意识。他们的自我形象是施虐者对他们的概念化的内化。[7]
Trauma bonds have severe detrimental effects on the victim. Some long-term impacts of trauma bonding include remaining in abusive relationships, adverse mental health outcomes like low self-esteem and negative self-image, an increased likelihood of depression and bipolar disorder, and perpetuating a generational cycle of abuse.[1][5][8][9] Victims who develop trauma bonds are often unable or unwilling to leave these relationships. Many abuse victims who experience trauma bonding return to the abusive relationship.[10][11]创伤纽带对受害者有严重的不利影响。创伤纽带的一些长期影响包括继续处于虐待关系中、不良的心理健康结果（如自卑和负面自我形象）、患抑郁症和双相情感障碍的可能性增加，以及使虐待的代际循环永久化。[1][5][8][9] 建立创伤纽带的受害者通常无法或不愿意离开这些关系。许多经历创伤联系的虐待受害者会回到虐待关系中。[10][11]

Context  上下文[edit]
In the 1980s, Donald G. Dutton and Susan L. Painter explored the concept of traumatic bonding theory in the context of abusive relationships and domestic violence.[2][12] This work was then further studied in the contexts of parent-child relationships, sexual exploitation, and more. Patrick Carnes described trauma bonding as "the misuse of fear, excitement, sexual feelings, and sexual physiology to entangle another person."[13] Traumatic bonding is also described as "[a] strong emotional attachment between an abused person and his or her abuser, formed as a result of the cycle of violence."[14] Carnes also studied traumatic bonding theory in the context of betrayal, which involved the exploitation of the victim's trust and/or sense of power by the abuser.[15]在 1980 年代，Donald G. Dutton 和 Susan L. Painter 在虐待关系和家庭暴力的背景下探索了创伤性结合理论的概念。[2][12] 然后在亲子关系、 性剥削等背景下进一步研究了这项工作。 帕特里克·卡恩斯 （Patrick Carnes） 将创伤纽带描述为“滥用恐惧 、 兴奋 、 性感觉和性生理学来纠缠另一个人”。[13] 创伤性联系也被描述为“受虐待者与施虐者之间因暴力循环而形成的强烈情感依恋”。[14] 卡恩斯还研究了背叛背景下的创伤性结合理论，其中涉及施虐者对受害者信任和/或权力感的剥削 。[15]

Establishment  建立[edit]
Trauma bonds are formed in abused-abuser and/or victim-victimizer dynamics. A victim can form a trauma bond with an abuser in the presence of a perceived threat from the abuser. Trauma bonds also form when the victim believes the abuser will follow through with a threat, when the victim perceives some form of kindness from the abuser, when the victim is isolated from outsider perspectives, and when the victim perceives a lack of ability or capacity to leave the situation.[16]创伤纽带是在虐待者-施虐者和/或受害者-受害者动态中形成的。当施虐者感知到威胁时，受害者可以与施虐者形成创伤纽带。当受害者相信施虐者会继续威胁时，当受害者感知到施虐者的某种形式的善意时，当受害者与外界的观点隔离时，以及当受害者认为缺乏能力或能力离开这种情况时，也会形成创伤纽带。[16]
The first incident of abuse is often perceived as an anomaly, a one-off instance occurring at the beginning of a seemingly healthy and positive relationship that is often not very severe. Furthermore, the expression of affection and care by the abuser following the incident pacifies the victim and instills in them the belief that the abuse is not recurring. However, repeated instances of abuse and maltreatment later generate a cognitive shift in the victim's mind: that preventing the abuse is not in their power. When the inability to escape the abuse becomes apparent, the emotional trauma bond is already strong.[12]第一次虐待事件通常被认为是一种异常现象，是一次性发生在看似健康和积极的关系开始时，通常不是很严重。此外，施虐者在事件发生后表达的爱意和关怀可以安抚受害者，并向他们灌输虐待不会再次发生的信念。然而，反复发生的虐待和虐待事件后来在受害者的思想中产生了认知转变：防止虐待不是他们有能力的。当无法摆脱虐待变得明显时，情感创伤纽带已经很牢固了。[12]
Two main factors facilitate forming and continuing a trauma bond: a power imbalance and intermittent reinforcement.[17][18]两个主要因素有助于形成和延续创伤纽带：权力不平衡和间歇性强化。[17] [18]

Power imbalance  功率不平衡[edit]
For a trauma bond to persist, a power differential must exist between the abuser and the victim such that the abuser is in a position of power and authority and the victim is not. Inequality in power can produce pathologies in individuals that can fortify the trauma bond. Upon experiencing intermittent punishment from the abuser or dominant individual, who is in a position of high power, the victim may internalize the abuser's perception of themselves.[2] This may result in a tendency for the victim to blame themselves in situations of violence perpetrated by the abuser, which can negatively impact the victim's self-concept.
为了使创伤纽带持续存在，施虐者和受害者之间必须存在权力差异，以便施虐者处于权力和权威的位置，而受害者则不然。权力不平等会在个人身上产生病态，从而加强创伤纽带。在经历施虐者或处于高位的支配者的间歇性惩罚后，受害者可能会内化施虐者对自己的看法。[2] 这可能会导致受害者在施虐者实施暴力的情况下倾向于责备自己，从而对受害者的自我概念产生负面影响。A negative self-appraisal can maximize the emotional dependency on the abuser and the cyclical nature of this dependency. Negative self-concept can eventually lead to the formation of a strong emotional bond from the victim to the abuser (i.e., to the person who is in a position of power and authority from the person who is not). Furthermore, physical, emotional, and sexual abuse can be used to maintain the power differential. This dynamic is also maintained via the interaction of the abuser's sense of power and the victim's sense of powerlessness and subjugation.[2]消极的自我评价可以最大限度地增加对施虐者的情感依赖以及这种依赖的周期性。消极的自我概念最终会导致受害者与施虐者（即与非施虐者之间处于权力和权威地位的人）之间形成强烈的情感纽带。此外，身体、情感和性虐待可以用来维持权力差异。这种动态也通过施虐者的权力感和受害者的无力感和征服感的相互作用来维持。[2]

Intermittent reinforcement间歇性加固[edit]
Intermittent reinforcement of rewards and punishments is crucial to establishing and maintaining a trauma bond. In trauma bonding, the abuser intermittently maltreats the victim through physical, verbal, emotional, and/or psychological abuse. This maltreatment is interspersed with positive behaviors like expressing affection and care, showing kindness, giving the victim gifts, and promising not to repeat the abuse. Alternating and sporadic periods of good and bad treatment serve to reinforce the victim intermittently.[2]间歇性强化奖励和惩罚对于建立和维持创伤纽带至关重要。在创伤联系中，施虐者通过身体、言语、情感和/或心理虐待间歇性地虐待受害者。这种虐待中穿插着积极的行为，例如表达爱意和关怀、表现出善意、给受害者礼物以及承诺不再重复虐待。交替和零星的好和坏待遇会间歇性地强化受害者。[2]
The pervasiveness of learning something through intermittent reinforcement can be elucidated by drawing from learning theory and the behaviorist perspective. In the presence of an aversive stimulus, reinforcement through rewards in unpredictable ways is a key component of learning. When the learner is unable to predict when they will get the reward, learning is maximized. Similarly, the intermittent expressions of affection and care are unexpected, and the inability to predict them makes them more sought after. Intermittent reinforcement produces behavioral patterns that are tough to terminate. Thus, they develop incredibly strong emotional bonds.[2]通过间歇性强化学习某事的普遍性可以通过学习理论和行为主义的观点来阐明。在存在厌恶刺激的情况下，通过以不可预测的方式奖励进行强化是学习的关键组成部分。当学习者无法预测他们何时会获得奖励时，学习就会最大化。同样，断断续续的爱意和关怀表达也是出乎意料的，无法预测也让它们更加受到追捧。间歇性强化会产生难以终止的行为模式。因此，他们建立了令人难以置信的强烈情感纽带。[2]

Maintenance  保养[edit]
A trauma bond can be maintained by keeping the power imbalance and the intermittency of abuse intact.
通过保持权力不平衡和虐待的间歇性完好无损，可以维持创伤纽带。Trauma bonds can also be maintained if the victim is financially dependent on the abuser or has some investment in the relationship, such as a child with the abuser.[6]如果受害者在经济上依赖施虐者或对这种关系有一些投资，例如与施虐者的孩子，也可以维持创伤纽带。[6]
Cognitive dissonance theory can also explain the maintenance of a trauma bond; it postulates that when individuals experience a conflict between their beliefs and actions, they are motivated to reduce or eliminate the incongruence to minimize the psychological discomfort. In this vein, victims may distort their cognition about the trauma and violence of the relationship to maintain a positive view of the relationship. This can involve rationalizing the abuser's behavior, justifications, minimizing the impact of the abuser's violence, and/or self-blaming.[6]认知失调理论也可以解释创伤纽带的维持;它假设，当个人经历他们的信念和行为之间的冲突时，他们有动力减少或消除不一致，以尽量减少心理不适。在这种精神下，受害者可能会扭曲他们对关系的创伤和暴力的认知，以保持对关系的积极看法。这可能涉及合理化施虐者的行为、理由、尽量减少施虐者暴力的影响和/或自责。[6]
Furthermore, research shows that the memory of instances wherein abuse was experienced is dissociated or state-dependent, meaning that the memories of abuse only fully resurface when the situation is similar in intensity and experience to the original situation of terror.[19]此外，研究表明，遭受虐待的记忆是分离的或依赖于状态的，这意味着只有当情况的强度和经历与最初的恐怖情况相似时，虐待的记忆才会完全重新出现。[19]
If and when the victim finally decides to leave the abusive relationship, the immediate relief from the traumatizing violence will begin to abate, and the underlying, deep attachment formed from intermittent reinforcement will begin to surface. This current period of vulnerability and emotional exhaustion will likely trigger memories of when the abuser was temporarily affectionate and caring. In the desire to receive that affection once more, the victim may try to return to the abusive relationship.[12][2]如果受害者最终决定离开虐待关系，那么从创伤性暴力中得到的直接缓解将开始减弱，而间歇性强化形成的潜在的、深层的依恋将开始浮出水面。当前的脆弱和情绪疲惫的时期可能会引发施虐者暂时深情和关怀的记忆。为了再次获得这种感情，受害者可能会试图回到虐待关系中。[12][2]
Strong social support, however, can be a protective factor in preserving the victim's functioning and providing a buffer in traumatic situations.[20]然而，强有力的社会支持可以成为保护受害者功能并在创伤情况下提供缓冲的保护因素。[20]

The role of attachment  依恋的作用[edit]
John Bowlby maintained that secure attachment was an evolutionary human need that superseded even the need for food and reproduction.[2] Attachment has been explored in depth in caregiver-child dynamics, but recent research has shown that the principles that explain attachment between caregivers and infants can also explain attachment throughout one's life span, specifically in the context of intimate relationships and romantic bonds.[21]约翰·鲍尔比坚持认为，安全依恋是人类进化的一种需求，甚至取代了对食物和繁殖的需求。[2] 依恋在照顾者与儿童的动态中得到了深入的探讨，但最近的研究表明，解释照顾者和婴儿之间依恋的原则也可以解释一个人一生中的依恋，特别是在亲密关系和浪漫纽带的背景下。[21]
Attachment bonds formed during early life lay the foundation for interpersonal relationships, interactions, personality characteristics, and mental health in the future.[22] Infants usually form attachments with their parents or immediate caregivers. Harlow's research on monkeys shows that infant monkeys form attachment bonds even with abusive mothers (in the experimental setup, the abusive 'mother' was a monkey made out of fabric who delivered mild shocks to the infant monkey or flung the infant monkey across the arena). 
早年形成的依恋纽带为未来的人际关系、互动、性格特征和心理健康奠定了基础。[22] 婴儿通常与父母或直接照顾者形成依恋。 哈洛对猴子的研究表明，即使与虐待的母亲，幼猴也会形成依恋纽带（在实验设置中，虐待的“母亲”是一只由织物制成的猴子，它对幼猴进行轻微的电击或将幼猴扔过竞技场）。These findings also apply to human attachment bonds. Even in situations where immediate caregivers are abusive, human infants still tend to attach to them; rejection from a caregiver only enhances the efforts to increase proximity to them and establish an attachment bond with them.[19]
Furthermore, in situations of danger, humans seek increased attachment. When ordinary pathways of attachment are unavailable, people tend to turn to their abusers. This leads to strong bonds and deep emotional connections with abusers. This attachment—both to abusive caregivers and to other abusers in the absence of a main caregiver—may be adaptive in the short run as it may aid survival. But in the long run, this attachment is maladaptive and can lay the foundation for, increase vulnerability to, and even directly lead to trauma bonding.

Stockholm syndrome[edit]
The concept of trauma bonding is often conflated with Stockholm syndrome. Although there are overarching similarities between the two, especially in the context of developing an emotional bond with one's abuser, trauma bonding and Stockholm syndrome are distinct from one another. The main difference is the direction of the relationship.[1]
In other words, in the case of Stockholm syndrome, the emotional connection is reciprocal, such that the abuser also appears to develop an emotional connection towards the abused and harbor positive feelings for the abused, in addition to the abused developing an emotional bond with the abuser.[1]

In abusive relationships[edit]


Although the victim may disclose the abuse, the trauma bond means that the victim may wish to receive comfort from the very person who abused them.


PACE UK[23]
Unhealthy, or traumatic, bonding occurs between people in an abusive relationship. The bond is stronger for people who have grown up in abusive households and who believe abuse to be a normal part of relationships.[13] On the psychometric scale for Stockholm syndrome, the three main components are: justifying an abuser through cognitive distortions, damage, ongoing psychological effects of abuse, and love.[6]
Initially, the abuser is inconsistent in approach, increasing in intensity over time. As the bond progresses, it may become more difficult for victims to leave abusers with whom they have bonded.[13]
Fear, children, and financial constraints may be factors preventing victims from leaving abusive relationships.[24]

Battered women[edit]
Initial research about battered women held the view that a victim's return to an abusive relationship was an indicator of a flawed personality and, more specifically, masochism.[12] However, this view was perpetuated by the 'just-world fallacy', the cognitive bias towards the idea that people "get what is coming for them". The tendency to victim-blame arises from the belief that the world is a just and fair place where the victim is seen as deserving of any negative consequences. However, research on battered women and research on traumatic bonding have shown that that is not the case. In terms of battered women's decision to stay in or return to an abusive relationship, many factors are at play, ranging from family history and role expectations to access to resources to the dynamics of the relationship itself.[12] A crucial part of the relationship's dynamic is the existence of a trauma bond. Maltreatment interspersed with periods of kindness aids in the formation of a trauma bond that makes the victim harbor positive feelings towards the abuser.[12]
Among battered women, a three-phase process can explain the intermittent reward-punishment cycle. During phase one, there is a gradual increase in tension, followed by an "explosive battering incident" in phase two, which is then followed by a peaceful expression of love and affection from the abuser during phase three. These phases' recurring and cyclical nature gives rise to a trauma bond.[2]

Sex trafficking[edit]
Trauma bonds are extremely common in situations of sex trafficking, child grooming, commercial sexual exploitation of children (CSEC), and pimp-prostitute relationships.

Grooming[edit]
Child grooming involves establishing and maintaining trauma bonds between the child and the abuser. Along with the factors of power imbalance and intermittent reinforcement that contribute to trauma bonding, child grooming also necessitates gaining the trust of those around the child. Grooming also involves gaining the child's trust while simultaneously violating their boundaries. Treats and trips are used as bribes to both gain access to the child as well as ensure that they comply.[25] Intense attachments coupled with cognitive distortions deepen the bond.
A 2019 case study explores the life of one individual who was groomed. The victim's perception of the abuser as a benefactor, a substitute parent, and a mind controller all contributed to the development of a traumatic bond between the victim and the abuser.[25] In terms of being a benefactor, the abuser in this case study went above and beyond to give the victim what they needed. From getting the victim a job to gifting them a plot of land for their first house, the abuser was always present as a benefactor. The abuser also acted as a substitute parent, advising and offering emotional support in times of crisis. The roles of the abuser as a benefactor and substitute parent constituted the good treatment necessary to establish a trauma bond. In contrast, the abuser's role as a mind controller involved controlling and dominating tendencies that emulated being brainwashed.[25] This combination of perceptions established a traumatic bond that the victim found incredibly difficult to break because rejecting the emotional connection as a whole would also involve rejecting the perks and benefits—the trips, the gifts, the treats, the confidante, and the caretaker.
Child grooming can be understood from a developmental perspective as well, and the relationship between the victim and the abuser evolves across the lifespan. Grooming starts when the child is extremely young—the trust of the child and the family is acquired. The child is given immense attention and is showered with gifts.[25] As the individual matures and enters adolescence, the abuser becomes a confidante and a benefactor. In the case study mentioned previously, the abuser gave the victim career advice, picked him up, and dropped him off at school. Then, at the onset of adulthood, the abuser provided the victim with land to build their home and became the person the victim brought their partner home to. As the victim's developmental needs evolved, so did the abuser's response, such that the only thing constant was the victim's need for affection. In other words, the abuser was "able to capitalize on [the victim's] relational needs" until the victim was able to meet those needs in other ways.[25]

Commercial sexual exploitation of children (CSEC)[edit]
The commercial sexual exploitation of children (CSEC) can cause debilitating physical and psychological trauma. Along with causing functional impairments, it can amplify risk-taking behaviors and increase impulse dysregulation, further compromising the child's ability to conceptualize, comprehend, establish, and maintain boundaries. This can lead to confusion regarding what safety, affection, intimacy, and kindness entail, resulting in the formation of a trauma bond with the abuser or trafficker that is based on skewed perceptions of safety and kindness.[1] The trauma bond deepens and strengthens when isolation and threats to survival increase, forcing the victim to depend almost entirely on the abuser for survival and protection. This increased emotional dependence on the abuser normalizes the emotional violence experienced by the victim at the hands of the abuser, and gradually, the victim develops a sense of trust and safety, albeit skewed, towards the abuser.[1]

Trauma-coercive bond[edit]
Trauma bonding thrives in the presence of a power imbalance and intermittent reward/punishment behavior. Trauma-coercive bonding, on the other hand, has two additional elements: social isolation and the perceived inability to escape the situation. Since these two elements are crucial to the experiences of victims of CSEC, their bonds with their abusers are better described as trauma-coercive bonds rather than simply as trauma bonds. The element of coercion concreted by social isolation and the perceived inability to escape makes the trauma bond more complex and far more deeply rooted.[1] The use of coercive trauma bonding encapsulates the psycho-social dynamics of a relationship between a victim and a perpetrator of CSEC.

Intimate partner violence (IPV)[edit]
IPV has been defined as physical, sexual, psychological, economic, or stalking abuse, both concrete and menaced, perpetuated by current or ex-partners. Trauma bonding is used to solidify this type of relationship by rationalizing and/or minimizing a violent partner's behavior, self-blame, and reporting love in the context of fear.

Parent-child relationships[edit]
Trauma bonds in parent-child or caregiver-child dynamics can be borne from abuse, neglect, or incestuous relationships.[26]

Abuse and/or neglect[edit]
Children of dismissive caregivers or cruel caregivers can develop insecure attachments, which can be very dysfunctional. Inconsistencies in reward and punishment (i.e., intermittent reinforcement of good and bad treatment) can highlight the affection the child receives from the parent, forcing a split between the abuse and the kindness such that the child seeks to form an overall positive view of the caregiver and thus focuses only on the affection and kindness they receive.[15][8] Overall, a trauma bond develops such that the child's sense of self is derived from their emotional dependence on the authority figure, who, in this case, is the parent and/or caregiver.

Incest[edit]
Incestuous relationships between parents and children cultivate trauma bonds similar to those prevalent in victims of sex trafficking. All participants in a 1994 study by Jane Kay Hedberg on trauma in adult incest survivors demonstrated some trauma bonding with their abusers.[27] There was a positive correlation between the pervasiveness of the trauma bond and the amount of contact the victim or the victim's close family members had with the abuser: those who self-reported less pervasive trauma also reported sustained contact with their abuser, while those who self-reported more pervasive trauma demonstrated an active avoidance of maintaining a relationship with their abuser. In incestuous parent-child dynamics, the study found that maintaining an unhealthy relationship with the abuser contributes to trauma and sustains the trauma bond.[27] However, Hedberg cautions against generalizing findings from the study since the sample was small (n = 11) and wasn't representative of the general population of incest survivors.[footnote 1]
This aligns with the idea that trauma bonds are toxic and difficult to leave due to the inherent power imbalance, which, in parent-child relationships, is even more pervasive than in other situations. Incestuous relationships also have an added layer of betrayal trauma, which arises from the exploitation of the victim's trust, resulting in a feeling of betrayal.[22]

Military (tours of duty)[edit]
Trauma bonds can develop in military settings. The literature demonstrates this specifically in the context of tours of duty, wherein military personnel are deployed in hostile environments or areas of combat. A 2019 study exploring this specific phenomenon sought to understand the traumatic bond developed between Japanese soldiers and Korean 'comfort women' in the midst of World War II.[28] The trauma, in this case, was two-fold: not only did the trauma bond develop in an abused-abuser dynamic, but the trauma itself was also a result of and was perpetuated by the war. While the relationships provided the Japanese soldiers with emotional relief and an escape from the violence of the war and the tyranny of the higher-ranking officers, they also provided the Korean 'comfort women' with much-desired protection and kindness from the soldiers.[28]
Soldiers would behave aggressively and violently towards the 'comfort women' and often sexually exploit them. They would use intimidation tactics to assert dominance and foster coercion. However, this abuse would be interspersed with kindness and empathy from the soldiers, whose moods and subsequent behavior and interactions were highly contingent on the time and context of the ongoing war.[28] Nonetheless, the intermittent kindness allowed the formation and maintenance of a trauma bond. Intermittent rewards were sometimes also more tangible, in the form of food, outings, and physical protection. However, protection and emotional support were pivotal in maintaining the trauma bonds and far more important than food and outings. The Korean 'comfort women' eventually came to be emotionally dependent on the Japanese soldiers and began to relate this dependence with their own sense of power, thereby establishing a trauma bond that, for some, persisted even after the war was over.[28]

Outcomes[edit]
Trauma bonding has several short-term and long-term impacts on the abused. It can force people to stay in abusive relationships, negatively affect self-image and self-esteem, perpetuate transgenerational cycles of abuse, and result in adverse mental health outcomes like an increased likelihood of developing depression and/or bipolar disorder.[9][8][5][1]

Staying in abusive relationships[edit]
Owing to the debilitating psychological manipulation involved in the development of a trauma bond, abused people tend to stay in abusive relationships, mainly because the perceived consequences of leaving the relationship seem far more negative than the consequences of staying in the abusive relationship.[6][2]
In such relationships, maltreatment is often interspersed with fragments of solace and peace that involve the expression of love, kindness, affection, and/or general friendliness from the abuser towards the abused.[6] This intermittent reinforcement of a reward (here, the abuser's love and kindness) amidst all the abuse becomes what the victim begins to hold on to. Thus, victims tend to become emotionally dependent on the abuser and construct the belief that their survival is contingent upon receiving the abuser's love.[6] Victims thereby begin to formulate their sense of identity (a form of self) around receiving the abuser's affection, which points to what could be gaslighting. Kindness and affection from the abuser amidst the abuse become a focal point for the victim's emotional dependence. This dependency is characterized by the belief that their survival is contingent on the abuser's love and affection, leading victims to construct their sense of identity and self-worth around this dynamic.[29] Additionally, the provision of intermittent love and affection makes the victim cling to the hope that things can change.[11] Furthermore, self-blame, the fear of social stigma and embarrassment, the fear of loneliness in the absence of a partner, and the lack of or poor social support from other family and friends also contribute to individuals remaining in abusive relationships.[11]

Perpetuation of transgenerational cycles of abuse[edit]
People who have experienced trauma and traumatic bonds can, knowingly or unknowingly, repeat the cycle of abuse. In other words, victims who were traumatically bonded with abusers may grow to become abusers themselves. The abuse that victims inflict may or may not involve trauma bonding.[9]
For instance, in a 2018 study on convicted child murderers, researchers found that caregivers who committed child homicide (murdered their child or care receiver) had experienced traumatic experiences and had trauma bonds with abusers in their early lives.[8] Individuals with cruel and/or dismissive caregivers are likely to develop insecure attachments that result in a host of problems, including emotion deregulation and an attitude of confusion towards the caregiver, who becomes a source of comfort as well as fear. These adverse attachments can manifest in an individual's relationship with their own children as well. Attachment issues and painful memories of trauma bonds with their own caregivers can be triggered, and individuals may demonstrate heightened and disproportionate aggression toward their child, some culminating in homicide.[8] In this study, participants experienced physical abuse, sexual abuse, a lack of protection from external dangers, abandonment, emotional rejection, and more from their caregivers. Nonetheless, participants expressed unconditional love towards their caregivers, justified by wanting to maintain an overall positive view of them.[8] In their continued efforts to form an emotional connection, a trauma bond was fostered. These experiences had a severe negative impact on their relationship and bonding with their own children, contributing to "affectionless, unempathetic interpersonal behavior" that inflated aggressive and violent tendencies triggered by vulnerabilities.[8]

Neurophysiological outcomes[edit]
The experience of being in a trauma bond can have adverse neurological and neurophysiological outcomes. The body of the victim of a trauma bond is in a perpetual 'fight-or-flight' response state, which can increase cortisol levels that can have a cascading effect and trigger other hormones. 
Persistent, chronic stress can also hamper the cellular response in the body, thereby negatively impacting immunity, organ health, mood, energy levels, and more.[1] In the long run, this can cause epigenetic changes as well. Furthermore, a study conducted in 2015 found that establishing a trauma bond in infancy is also linked with amygdala dysfunction, neurobehavioral deficits, and increased vulnerability to psychiatric disorders later on in life.[30] Psychological abuse is correlated with sleep-related impairments. Disruption in sleep patterns leads to adverse neurophysiological problems, such as an increase in anxiety and irritability. For victims of psychological abuse, the increase in cortisol affects the brain in such a manner that it allows the trauma bonding to be strengthened.[31]

Adverse mental health outcomes[edit]
Trauma bonding is linked to several adverse mental health and well-being outcomes. Due to the abuse and the emotional dependence on their abusers, victims tend to develop an incredibly negative self-image. "Controlling, restricting, degrading, isolating, or dominating" abuse has a crippling effect on the self-image and self-esteem of the abused, and this psychological abuse is far more dangerous than physical abuse.[5] In a 2010 study on battered women labeling themselves as "stupid", researchers found that victims who felt like they allowed themselves to be mistreated and victims who stayed in abusive relationships labeled themselves as "stupid" for doing so.[10] This further contributes to a negative self-image and the maintenance of low self-esteem, both of which foster a poor self-concept, which, in turn, adversely impacts mental well-being. The same was observed in the case study mentioned previously on grooming.[25]
Trauma bonding can also lead to dissociative symptoms that could be a self-preservation and/or coping mechanism. Neurobiological changes can also affect brain development and hamper learning. The internalization of psychological manipulation and trauma can cause anxiety and increase the likelihood of engaging in risk-taking behaviors.[1] Furthermore, the isolation involved in trauma bonding can foster a generally skewed sense of trust, making victims vulnerable to situations that may retraumatize or revictimize them. Victims may also tend to either completely dismiss or minimize dangerous, damaging behaviors and violence around them.[1]
Trauma bonds in parent-child relationships (wherein the child is the victim and the parent is the abuser) can also lead to depressive symptoms later in life.[9] In a 2017 study exploring this, it was found that an "affectionless control" parenting style, characterized by high protection and low care from parents, was a major predictor of depressive symptomology for the victim. In other words, the presence of poor parental bonding coupled with childhood trauma bonds increased the likelihood of the child developing depressive symptoms in the future. A negative self-image is formed when feelings of inadequacy and hopelessness persist and are reinforced by caregivers. Perpetual efforts to seek secure emotional attachments reap no rewards, and a trauma bond facilitates a negative core schema that influences perceptions and interactions throughout one's life.[9] This can give rise to mental health issues such as depression, bipolar disorder, mania, suicidality, and substance abuse that can be pervasive and lifelong.

003. The two main factors that contribute to the establishment of a trauma bond are a power imbalance and intermittent reward and punishment.[2][1][5] Trauma bonding can occur within romantic relationships, platonic friendships, parent-child relationships, incestuous relationships, cults, hostage situations, sex trafficking (especially that of minors), hazing or tours of duty among military personnel.[2][6]促成创伤纽带建立的两个主要因素是权力失衡和间歇性奖惩。[2] [1] [5] 创伤纽带可能发生在浪漫关系、柏拉图式友谊、亲子关系、 关系 、 邪教 、 人质事件、 易 （尤其是未成年人的易）、 欺凌或军事人员的执行任务中。[2][6]
Trauma bonds are based on terror, dominance, and unpredictability. As the trauma bond between an abuser and a victim strengthens, it can lead to cyclical patterns of conflicting emotions. Frequently, victims in trauma bonds do not have agency, autonomy, or an individual sense of self. Their self-image is an internalization of the abuser's conceptualization of them.[7]创伤纽带基于恐怖、支配和不可预测性。随着施虐者和受害者之间的创伤纽带加强，它可能导致情绪冲突的周期性模式。通常，创伤债券中的受害者没有能动性、自主权或个人自我意识。他们的自我形象是施虐者对他们的概念化的内化。[7]
Trauma bonds have severe detrimental effects on the victim. Some long-term impacts of trauma bonding include remaining in abusive relationships, adverse mental health outcomes like low self-esteem and negative self-image, an increased likelihood of depression and bipolar disorder, and perpetuating a generational cycle of abuse.[1][5][8][9] Victims who develop trauma bonds are often unable or unwilling to leave these relationships. Many abuse victims who experience trauma bonding return to the abusive relationship.[10][11]创伤纽带对受害者有严重的不利影响。创伤纽带的一些长期影响包括继续处于虐待关系中、不良的心理健康结果（如自卑和负面自我形象）、患抑郁症和双相情感障碍的可能性增加，以及使虐待的代际循环永久化。[1][5][8][9] 建立创伤纽带的受害者通常无法或不愿意离开这些关系。许多经历创伤联系的虐待受害者会回到虐待关系中。[10][11]

Context  上下文[edit]
In the 1980s, Donald G. Dutton and Susan L. Painter explored the concept of traumatic bonding theory in the context of abusive relationships and domestic violence.[2][12] This work was then further studied in the contexts of parent-child relationships, sexual exploitation, and more. Patrick Carnes described trauma bonding as "the misuse of fear, excitement, sexual feelings, and sexual physiology to entangle another person."[13] Traumatic bonding is also described as "[a] strong emotional attachment between an abused person and his or her abuser, formed as a result of the cycle of violence."[14] Carnes also studied traumatic bonding theory in the context of betrayal, which involved the exploitation of the victim's trust and/or sense of power by the abuser.[15]在 1980 年代，Donald G. Dutton 和 Susan L. Painter 在虐待关系和家庭暴力的背景下探索了创伤性结合理论的概念。[2][12] 然后在亲子关系、 性剥削等背景下进一步研究了这项工作。 帕特里克·卡恩斯 （Patrick Carnes） 将创伤纽带描述为“滥用恐惧 、 兴奋 、 性感觉和性生理学来纠缠另一个人”。[13] 创伤性联系也被描述为“受虐待者与施虐者之间因暴力循环而形成的强烈情感依恋”。[14] 卡恩斯还研究了背叛背景下的创伤性结合理论，其中涉及施虐者对受害者信任和/或权力感的剥削 。[15]

Establishment  建立[edit]
Trauma bonds are formed in abused-abuser and/or victim-victimizer dynamics. A victim can form a trauma bond with an abuser in the presence of a perceived threat from the abuser. Trauma bonds also form when the victim believes the abuser will follow through with a threat, when the victim perceives some form of kindness from the abuser, when the victim is isolated from outsider perspectives, and when the victim perceives a lack of ability or capacity to leave the situation.[16]创伤纽带是在虐待者-施虐者和/或受害者-受害者动态中形成的。当施虐者感知到威胁时，受害者可以与施虐者形成创伤纽带。当受害者相信施虐者会继续威胁时，当受害者感知到施虐者的某种形式的善意时，当受害者与外界的观点隔离时，以及当受害者认为缺乏能力或能力离开这种情况时，也会形成创伤纽带。[16]
The first incident of abuse is often perceived as an anomaly, a one-off instance occurring at the beginning of a seemingly healthy and positive relationship that is often not very severe. Furthermore, the expression of affection and care by the abuser following the incident pacifies the victim and instills in them the belief that the abuse is not recurring. However, repeated instances of abuse and maltreatment later generate a cognitive shift in the victim's mind: that preventing the abuse is not in their power. When the inability to escape the abuse becomes apparent, the emotional trauma bond is already strong.[12]第一次虐待事件通常被认为是一种异常现象，是一次性发生在看似健康和积极的关系开始时，通常不是很严重。此外，施虐者在事件发生后表达的爱意和关怀可以安抚受害者，并向他们灌输虐待不会再次发生的信念。然而，反复发生的虐待和虐待事件后来在受害者的思想中产生了认知转变：防止虐待不是他们有能力的。当无法摆脱虐待变得明显时，情感创伤纽带已经很牢固了。[12]
Two main factors facilitate forming and continuing a trauma bond: a power imbalance and intermittent reinforcement.[17][18]两个主要因素有助于形成和延续创伤纽带：权力不平衡和间歇性强化。[17] [18]

Power imbalance  功率不平衡[edit]
For a trauma bond to persist, a power differential must exist between the abuser and the victim such that the abuser is in a position of power and authority and the victim is not. Inequality in power can produce pathologies in individuals that can fortify the trauma bond. Upon experiencing intermittent punishment from the abuser or dominant individual, who is in a position of high power, the victim may internalize the abuser's perception of themselves.[2] This may result in a tendency for the victim to blame themselves in situations of violence perpetrated by the abuser, which can negatively impact the victim's self-concept.
为了使创伤纽带持续存在，施虐者和受害者之间必须存在权力差异，以便施虐者处于权力和权威的位置，而受害者则不然。权力不平等会在个人身上产生病态，从而加强创伤纽带。在经历施虐者或处于高位的支配者的间歇性惩罚后，受害者可能会内化施虐者对自己的看法。[2] 这可能会导致受害者在施虐者实施暴力的情况下倾向于责备自己，从而对受害者的自我概念产生负面影响。A negative self-appraisal can maximize the emotional dependency on the abuser and the cyclical nature of this dependency. Negative self-concept can eventually lead to the formation of a strong emotional bond from the victim to the abuser (i.e., to the person who is in a position of power and authority from the person who is not). Furthermore, physical, emotional, and sexual abuse can be used to maintain the power differential. This dynamic is also maintained via the interaction of the abuser's sense of power and the victim's sense of powerlessness and subjugation.[2]消极的自我评价可以最大限度地增加对施虐者的情感依赖以及这种依赖的周期性。消极的自我概念最终会导致受害者与施虐者（即与非施虐者之间处于权力和权威地位的人）之间形成强烈的情感纽带。此外，身体、情感和性虐待可以用来维持权力差异。这种动态也通过施虐者的权力感和受害者的无力感和征服感的相互作用来维持。[2]

Intermittent reinforcement间歇性加固[edit]
Intermittent reinforcement of rewards and punishments is crucial to establishing and maintaining a trauma bond. In trauma bonding, the abuser intermittently maltreats the victim through physical, verbal, emotional, and/or psychological abuse. This maltreatment is interspersed with positive behaviors like expressing affection and care, showing kindness, giving the victim gifts, and promising not to repeat the abuse. Alternating and sporadic periods of good and bad treatment serve to reinforce the victim intermittently.[2]间歇性强化奖励和惩罚对于建立和维持创伤纽带至关重要。在创伤联系中，施虐者通过身体、言语、情感和/或心理虐待间歇性地虐待受害者。这种虐待中穿插着积极的行为，例如表达爱意和关怀、表现出善意、给受害者礼物以及承诺不再重复虐待。交替和零星的好和坏待遇会间歇性地强化受害者。[2]
The pervasiveness of learning something through intermittent reinforcement can be elucidated by drawing from learning theory and the behaviorist perspective. In the presence of an aversive stimulus, reinforcement through rewards in unpredictable ways is a key component of learning. When the learner is unable to predict when they will get the reward, learning is maximized. Similarly, the intermittent expressions of affection and care are unexpected, and the inability to predict them makes them more sought after. Intermittent reinforcement produces behavioral patterns that are tough to terminate. Thus, they develop incredibly strong emotional bonds.[2]通过间歇性强化学习某事的普遍性可以通过学习理论和行为主义的观点来阐明。在存在厌恶刺激的情况下，通过以不可预测的方式奖励进行强化是学习的关键组成部分。当学习者无法预测他们何时会获得奖励时，学习就会最大化。同样，断断续续的爱意和关怀表达也是出乎意料的，无法预测也让它们更加受到追捧。间歇性强化会产生难以终止的行为模式。因此，他们建立了令人难以置信的强烈情感纽带。[2]

Maintenance  保养[edit]
A trauma bond can be maintained by keeping the power imbalance and the intermittency of abuse intact.
通过保持权力不平衡和虐待的间歇性完好无损，可以维持创伤纽带。Trauma bonds can also be maintained if the victim is financially dependent on the abuser or has some investment in the relationship, such as a child with the abuser.[6]如果受害者在经济上依赖施虐者或对这种关系有一些投资，例如与施虐者的孩子，也可以维持创伤纽带。[6]
Cognitive dissonance theory can also explain the maintenance of a trauma bond; it postulates that when individuals experience a conflict between their beliefs and actions, they are motivated to reduce or eliminate the incongruence to minimize the psychological discomfort. In this vein, victims may distort their cognition about the trauma and violence of the relationship to maintain a positive view of the relationship. This can involve rationalizing the abuser's behavior, justifications, minimizing the impact of the abuser's violence, and/or self-blaming.[6]认知失调理论也可以解释创伤纽带的维持;它假设，当个人经历他们的信念和行为之间的冲突时，他们有动力减少或消除不一致，以尽量减少心理不适。在这种精神下，受害者可能会扭曲他们对关系的创伤和暴力的认知，以保持对关系的积极看法。这可能涉及合理化施虐者的行为、理由、尽量减少施虐者暴力的影响和/或自责。[6]
Furthermore, research shows that the memory of instances wherein abuse was experienced is dissociated or state-dependent, meaning that the memories of abuse only fully resurface when the situation is similar in intensity and experience to the original situation of terror.[19]此外，研究表明，遭受虐待的记忆是分离的或依赖于状态的，这意味着只有当情况的强度和经历与最初的恐怖情况相似时，虐待的记忆才会完全重新出现。[19]
If and when the victim finally decides to leave the abusive relationship, the immediate relief from the traumatizing violence will begin to abate, and the underlying, deep attachment formed from intermittent reinforcement will begin to surface. This current period of vulnerability and emotional exhaustion will likely trigger memories of when the abuser was temporarily affectionate and caring. In the desire to receive that affection once more, the victim may try to return to the abusive relationship.[12][2]如果受害者最终决定离开虐待关系，那么从创伤性暴力中得到的直接缓解将开始减弱，而间歇性强化形成的潜在的、深层的依恋将开始浮出水面。当前的脆弱和情绪疲惫的时期可能会引发施虐者暂时深情和关怀的记忆。为了再次获得这种感情，受害者可能会试图回到虐待关系中。[12][2]
Strong social support, however, can be a protective factor in preserving the victim's functioning and providing a buffer in traumatic situations.[20]然而，强有力的社会支持可以成为保护受害者功能并在创伤情况下提供缓冲的保护因素。[20]

The role of attachment  依恋的作用[edit]
John Bowlby maintained that secure attachment was an evolutionary human need that superseded even the need for food and reproduction.[2] Attachment has been explored in depth in caregiver-child dynamics, but recent research has shown that the principles that explain attachment between caregivers and infants can also explain attachment throughout one's life span, specifically in the context of intimate relationships and romantic bonds.[21]约翰·鲍尔比坚持认为，安全依恋是人类进化的一种需求，甚至取代了对食物和繁殖的需求。[2] 依恋在照顾者与儿童的动态中得到了深入的探讨，但最近的研究表明，解释照顾者和婴儿之间依恋的原则也可以解释一个人一生中的依恋，特别是在亲密关系和浪漫纽带的背景下。[21]
Attachment bonds formed during early life lay the foundation for interpersonal relationships, interactions, personality characteristics, and mental health in the future.[22] Infants usually form attachments with their parents or immediate caregivers. Harlow's research on monkeys shows that infant monkeys form attachment bonds even with abusive mothers (in the experimental setup, the abusive 'mother' was a monkey made out of fabric who delivered mild shocks to the infant monkey or flung the infant monkey across the arena). 
早年形成的依恋纽带为未来的人际关系、互动、性格特征和心理健康奠定了基础。[22] 婴儿通常与父母或直接照顾者形成依恋。 哈洛对猴子的研究表明，即使与虐待的母亲，幼猴也会形成依恋纽带（在实验设置中，虐待的“母亲”是一只由织物制成的猴子，它对幼猴进行轻微的电击或将幼猴扔过竞技场）。These findings also apply to human attachment bonds. Even in situations where immediate caregivers are abusive, human infants still tend to attach to them; rejection from a caregiver only enhances the efforts to increase proximity to them and establish an attachment bond with them.[19]
Furthermore, in situations of danger, humans seek increased attachment. When ordinary pathways of attachment are unavailable, people tend to turn to their abusers. This leads to strong bonds and deep emotional connections with abusers. This attachment—both to abusive caregivers and to other abusers in the absence of a main caregiver—may be adaptive in the short run as it may aid survival. But in the long run, this attachment is maladaptive and can lay the foundation for, increase vulnerability to, and even directly lead to trauma bonding.

Stockholm syndrome[edit]
The concept of trauma bonding is often conflated with Stockholm syndrome. Although there are overarching similarities between the two, especially in the context of developing an emotional bond with one's abuser, trauma bonding and Stockholm syndrome are distinct from one another. The main difference is the direction of the relationship.[1]
In other words, in the case of Stockholm syndrome, the emotional connection is reciprocal, such that the abuser also appears to develop an emotional connection towards the abused and harbor positive feelings for the abused, in addition to the abused developing an emotional bond with the abuser.[1]

Realms of existence[edit]

In abusive relationships[edit]


Although the victim may disclose the abuse, the trauma bond means that the victim may wish to receive comfort from the very person who abused them.


PACE UK[23]
Unhealthy, or traumatic, bonding occurs between people in an abusive relationship. The bond is stronger for people who have grown up in abusive households and who believe abuse to be a normal part of relationships.[13] On the psychometric scale for Stockholm syndrome, the three main components are: justifying an abuser through cognitive distortions, damage, ongoing psychological effects of abuse, and love.[6]
Initially, the abuser is inconsistent in approach, increasing in intensity over time. As the bond progresses, it may become more difficult for victims to leave abusers with whom they have bonded.[13]
Fear, children, and financial constraints may be factors preventing victims from leaving abusive relationships.[24]

Battered women[edit]
Initial research about battered women held the view that a victim's return to an abusive relationship was an indicator of a flawed personality and, more specifically, masochism.[12] However, this view was perpetuated by the 'just-world fallacy', the cognitive bias towards the idea that people "get what is coming for them". The tendency to victim-blame arises from the belief that the world is a just and fair place where the victim is seen as deserving of any negative consequences. However, research on battered women and research on traumatic bonding have shown that that is not the case. In terms of battered women's decision to stay in or return to an abusive relationship, many factors are at play, ranging from family history and role expectations to access to resources to the dynamics of the relationship itself.[12] A crucial part of the relationship's dynamic is the existence of a trauma bond. Maltreatment interspersed with periods of kindness aids in the formation of a trauma bond that makes the victim harbor positive feelings towards the abuser.[12]
Among battered women, a three-phase process can explain the intermittent reward-punishment cycle. During phase one, there is a gradual increase in tension, followed by an "explosive battering incident" in phase two, which is then followed by a peaceful expression of love and affection from the abuser during phase three. These phases' recurring and cyclical nature gives rise to a trauma bond.[2]

Sex trafficking[edit]
Trauma bonds are extremely common in situations of sex trafficking, child grooming, commercial sexual exploitation of children (CSEC), and pimp-prostitute relationships.

Grooming[edit]
Child grooming involves establishing and maintaining trauma bonds between the child and the abuser. Along with the factors of power imbalance and intermittent reinforcement that contribute to trauma bonding, child grooming also necessitates gaining the trust of those around the child. Grooming also involves gaining the child's trust while simultaneously violating their boundaries. Treats and trips are used as bribes to both gain access to the child as well as ensure that they comply.[25] Intense attachments coupled with cognitive distortions deepen the bond.
A 2019 case study explores the life of one individual who was groomed. The victim's perception of the abuser as a benefactor, a substitute parent, and a mind controller all contributed to the development of a traumatic bond between the victim and the abuser.[25] In terms of being a benefactor, the abuser in this case study went above and beyond to give the victim what they needed. From getting the victim a job to gifting them a plot of land for their first house, the abuser was always present as a benefactor. The abuser also acted as a substitute parent, advising and offering emotional support in times of crisis. The roles of the abuser as a benefactor and substitute parent constituted the good treatment necessary to establish a trauma bond. In contrast, the abuser's role as a mind controller involved controlling and dominating tendencies that emulated being brainwashed.[25] This combination of perceptions established a traumatic bond that the victim found incredibly difficult to break because rejecting the emotional connection as a whole would also involve rejecting the perks and benefits—the trips, the gifts, the treats, the confidante, and the caretaker.
Child grooming can be understood from a developmental perspective as well, and the relationship between the victim and the abuser evolves across the lifespan. Grooming starts when the child is extremely young—the trust of the child and the family is acquired. The child is given immense attention and is showered with gifts.[25] As the individual matures and enters adolescence, the abuser becomes a confidante and a benefactor. In the case study mentioned previously, the abuser gave the victim career advice, picked him up, and dropped him off at school. Then, at the onset of adulthood, the abuser provided the victim with land to build their home and became the person the victim brought their partner home to. As the victim's developmental needs evolved, so did the abuser's response, such that the only thing constant was the victim's need for affection. In other words, the abuser was "able to capitalize on [the victim's] relational needs" until the victim was able to meet those needs in other ways.[25]

Commercial sexual exploitation of children (CSEC)[edit]
The commercial sexual exploitation of children (CSEC) can cause debilitating physical and psychological trauma. Along with causing functional impairments, it can amplify risk-taking behaviors and increase impulse dysregulation, further compromising the child's ability to conceptualize, comprehend, establish, and maintain boundaries. This can lead to confusion regarding what safety, affection, intimacy, and kindness entail, resulting in the formation of a trauma bond with the abuser or trafficker that is based on skewed perceptions of safety and kindness.[1] The trauma bond deepens and strengthens when isolation and threats to survival increase, forcing the victim to depend almost entirely on the abuser for survival and protection. This increased emotional dependence on the abuser normalizes the emotional violence experienced by the victim at the hands of the abuser, and gradually, the victim develops a sense of trust and safety, albeit skewed, towards the abuser.[1]

Trauma-coercive bond[edit]
Trauma bonding thrives in the presence of a power imbalance and intermittent reward/punishment behavior. Trauma-coercive bonding, on the other hand, has two additional elements: social isolation and the perceived inability to escape the situation. Since these two elements are crucial to the experiences of victims of CSEC, their bonds with their abusers are better described as trauma-coercive bonds rather than simply as trauma bonds. The element of coercion concreted by social isolation and the perceived inability to escape makes the trauma bond more complex and far more deeply rooted.[1] The use of coercive trauma bonding encapsulates the psycho-social dynamics of a relationship between a victim and a perpetrator of CSEC.

Intimate partner violence (IPV)[edit]
IPV has been defined as physical, sexual, psychological, economic, or stalking abuse, both concrete and menaced, perpetuated by current or ex-partners. Trauma bonding is used to solidify this type of relationship by rationalizing and/or minimizing a violent partner's behavior, self-blame, and reporting love in the context of fear.

Parent-child relationships[edit]
Trauma bonds in parent-child or caregiver-child dynamics can be borne from abuse, neglect, or incestuous relationships.[26]

Abuse and/or neglect[edit]
Children of dismissive caregivers or cruel caregivers can develop insecure attachments, which can be very dysfunctional. Inconsistencies in reward and punishment (i.e., intermittent reinforcement of good and bad treatment) can highlight the affection the child receives from the parent, forcing a split between the abuse and the kindness such that the child seeks to form an overall positive view of the caregiver and thus focuses only on the affection and kindness they receive.[15][8] Overall, a trauma bond develops such that the child's sense of self is derived from their emotional dependence on the authority figure, who, in this case, is the parent and/or caregiver.

Incest[edit]
Incestuous relationships between parents and children cultivate trauma bonds similar to those prevalent in victims of sex trafficking. All participants in a 1994 study by Jane Kay Hedberg on trauma in adult incest survivors demonstrated some trauma bonding with their abusers.[27] There was a positive correlation between the pervasiveness of the trauma bond and the amount of contact the victim or the victim's close family members had with the abuser: those who self-reported less pervasive trauma also reported sustained contact with their abuser, while those who self-reported more pervasive trauma demonstrated an active avoidance of maintaining a relationship with their abuser. In incestuous parent-child dynamics, the study found that maintaining an unhealthy relationship with the abuser contributes to trauma and sustains the trauma bond.[27] However, Hedberg cautions against generalizing findings from the study since the sample was small (n = 11) and wasn't representative of the general population of incest survivors.[footnote 1]
This aligns with the idea that trauma bonds are toxic and difficult to leave due to the inherent power imbalance, which, in parent-child relationships, is even more pervasive than in other situations. Incestuous relationships also have an added layer of betrayal trauma, which arises from the exploitation of the victim's trust, resulting in a feeling of betrayal.[22]

Military (tours of duty)[edit]
Trauma bonds can develop in military settings. The literature demonstrates this specifically in the context of tours of duty, wherein military personnel are deployed in hostile environments or areas of combat. A 2019 study exploring this specific phenomenon sought to understand the traumatic bond developed between Japanese soldiers and Korean 'comfort women' in the midst of World War II.[28] The trauma, in this case, was two-fold: not only did the trauma bond develop in an abused-abuser dynamic, but the trauma itself was also a result of and was perpetuated by the war. While the relationships provided the Japanese soldiers with emotional relief and an escape from the violence of the war and the tyranny of the higher-ranking officers, they also provided the Korean 'comfort women' with much-desired protection and kindness from the soldiers.[28]
Soldiers would behave aggressively and violently towards the 'comfort women' and often sexually exploit them. They would use intimidation tactics to assert dominance and foster coercion. However, this abuse would be interspersed with kindness and empathy from the soldiers, whose moods and subsequent behavior and interactions were highly contingent on the time and context of the ongoing war.[28] Nonetheless, the intermittent kindness allowed the formation and maintenance of a trauma bond. Intermittent rewards were sometimes also more tangible, in the form of food, outings, and physical protection. However, protection and emotional support were pivotal in maintaining the trauma bonds and far more important than food and outings. The Korean 'comfort women' eventually came to be emotionally dependent on the Japanese soldiers and began to relate this dependence with their own sense of power, thereby establishing a trauma bond that, for some, persisted even after the war was over.[28]

Outcomes[edit]
Trauma bonding has several short-term and long-term impacts on the abused. It can force people to stay in abusive relationships, negatively affect self-image and self-esteem, perpetuate transgenerational cycles of abuse, and result in adverse mental health outcomes like an increased likelihood of developing depression and/or bipolar disorder.[9][8][5][1]

Staying in abusive relationships[edit]
Owing to the debilitating psychological manipulation involved in the development of a trauma bond, abused people tend to stay in abusive relationships, mainly because the perceived consequences of leaving the relationship seem far more negative than the consequences of staying in the abusive relationship.[6][2]
In such relationships, maltreatment is often interspersed with fragments of solace and peace that involve the expression of love, kindness, affection, and/or general friendliness from the abuser towards the abused.[6] This intermittent reinforcement of a reward (here, the abuser's love and kindness) amidst all the abuse becomes what the victim begins to hold on to. Thus, victims tend to become emotionally dependent on the abuser and construct the belief that their survival is contingent upon receiving the abuser's love.[6] Victims thereby begin to formulate their sense of identity (a form of self) around receiving the abuser's affection, which points to what could be gaslighting. Kindness and affection from the abuser amidst the abuse become a focal point for the victim's emotional dependence. This dependency is characterized by the belief that their survival is contingent on the abuser's love and affection, leading victims to construct their sense of identity and self-worth around this dynamic.[29] Additionally, the provision of intermittent love and affection makes the victim cling to the hope that things can change.[11] Furthermore, self-blame, the fear of social stigma and embarrassment, the fear of loneliness in the absence of a partner, and the lack of or poor social support from other family and friends also contribute to individuals remaining in abusive relationships.[11]

Perpetuation of transgenerational cycles of abuse[edit]
People who have experienced trauma and traumatic bonds can, knowingly or unknowingly, repeat the cycle of abuse. In other words, victims who were traumatically bonded with abusers may grow to become abusers themselves. The abuse that victims inflict may or may not involve trauma bonding.[9]
For instance, in a 2018 study on convicted child murderers, researchers found that caregivers who committed child homicide (murdered their child or care receiver) had experienced traumatic experiences and had trauma bonds with abusers in their early lives.[8] Individuals with cruel and/or dismissive caregivers are likely to develop insecure attachments that result in a host of problems, including emotion deregulation and an attitude of confusion towards the caregiver, who becomes a source of comfort as well as fear. These adverse attachments can manifest in an individual's relationship with their own children as well. Attachment issues and painful memories of trauma bonds with their own caregivers can be triggered, and individuals may demonstrate heightened and disproportionate aggression toward their child, some culminating in homicide.[8] In this study, participants experienced physical abuse, sexual abuse, a lack of protection from external dangers, abandonment, emotional rejection, and more from their caregivers. Nonetheless, participants expressed unconditional love towards their caregivers, justified by wanting to maintain an overall positive view of them.[8] In their continued efforts to form an emotional connection, a trauma bond was fostered. These experiences had a severe negative impact on their relationship and bonding with their own children, contributing to "affectionless, unempathetic interpersonal behavior" that inflated aggressive and violent tendencies triggered by vulnerabilities.[8]

Neurophysiological outcomes[edit]
The experience of being in a trauma bond can have adverse neurological and neurophysiological outcomes. The body of the victim of a trauma bond is in a perpetual 'fight-or-flight' response state, which can increase cortisol levels that can have a cascading effect and trigger other hormones. 
Persistent, chronic stress can also hamper the cellular response in the body, thereby negatively impacting immunity, organ health, mood, energy levels, and more.[1] In the long run, this can cause epigenetic changes as well. Furthermore, a study conducted in 2015 found that establishing a trauma bond in infancy is also linked with amygdala dysfunction, neurobehavioral deficits, and increased vulnerability to psychiatric disorders later on in life.[30] Psychological abuse is correlated with sleep-related impairments. Disruption in sleep patterns leads to adverse neurophysiological problems, such as an increase in anxiety and irritability. For victims of psychological abuse, the increase in cortisol affects the brain in such a manner that it allows the trauma bonding to be strengthened.[31]

Adverse mental health outcomes[edit]
Trauma bonding is linked to several adverse mental health and well-being outcomes. Due to the abuse and the emotional dependence on their abusers, victims tend to develop an incredibly negative self-image. "Controlling, restricting, degrading, isolating, or dominating" abuse has a crippling effect on the self-image and self-esteem of the abused, and this psychological abuse is far more dangerous than physical abuse.[5] In a 2010 study on battered women labeling themselves as "stupid", researchers found that victims who felt like they allowed themselves to be mistreated and victims who stayed in abusive relationships labeled themselves as "stupid" for doing so.[10] This further contributes to a negative self-image and the maintenance of low self-esteem, both of which foster a poor self-concept, which, in turn, adversely impacts mental well-being. The same was observed in the case study mentioned previously on grooming.[25]
Trauma bonding can also lead to dissociative symptoms that could be a self-preservation and/or coping mechanism. Neurobiological changes can also affect brain development and hamper learning. The internalization of psychological manipulation and trauma can cause anxiety and increase the likelihood of engaging in risk-taking behaviors.[1] Furthermore, the isolation involved in trauma bonding can foster a generally skewed sense of trust, making victims vulnerable to situations that may retraumatize or revictimize them. Victims may also tend to either completely dismiss or minimize dangerous, damaging behaviors and violence around them.[1]
Trauma bonds in parent-child relationships (wherein the child is the victim and the parent is the abuser) can also lead to depressive symptoms later in life.[9] In a 2017 study exploring this, it was found that an "affectionless control" parenting style, characterized by high protection and low care from parents, was a major predictor of depressive symptomology for the victim. In other words, the presence of poor parental bonding coupled with childhood trauma bonds increased the likelihood of the child developing depressive symptoms in the future. A negative self-image is formed when feelings of inadequacy and hopelessness persist and are reinforced by caregivers. Perpetual efforts to seek secure emotional attachments reap no rewards, and a trauma bond facilitates a negative core schema that influences perceptions and interactions throughout one's life.[9] This can give rise to mental health issues such as depression, bipolar disorder, mania, suicidality, and substance abuse that can be pervasive and lifelong.

004. Trauma bonds are based on terror, dominance, and unpredictability. As the trauma bond between an abuser and a victim strengthens, it can lead to cyclical patterns of conflicting emotions. Frequently, victims in trauma bonds do not have agency, autonomy, or an individual sense of self. Their self-image is an internalization of the abuser's conceptualization of them.[7]创伤纽带基于恐怖、支配和不可预测性。随着施虐者和受害者之间的创伤纽带加强，它可能导致情绪冲突的周期性模式。通常，创伤债券中的受害者没有能动性、自主权或个人自我意识。他们的自我形象是施虐者对他们的概念化的内化。[7]
Trauma bonds have severe detrimental effects on the victim. Some long-term impacts of trauma bonding include remaining in abusive relationships, adverse mental health outcomes like low self-esteem and negative self-image, an increased likelihood of depression and bipolar disorder, and perpetuating a generational cycle of abuse.[1][5][8][9] Victims who develop trauma bonds are often unable or unwilling to leave these relationships. Many abuse victims who experience trauma bonding return to the abusive relationship.[10][11]创伤纽带对受害者有严重的不利影响。创伤纽带的一些长期影响包括继续处于虐待关系中、不良的心理健康结果（如自卑和负面自我形象）、患抑郁症和双相情感障碍的可能性增加，以及使虐待的代际循环永久化。[1][5][8][9] 建立创伤纽带的受害者通常无法或不愿意离开这些关系。许多经历创伤联系的虐待受害者会回到虐待关系中。[10][11]

Context  上下文[edit]
In the 1980s, Donald G. Dutton and Susan L. Painter explored the concept of traumatic bonding theory in the context of abusive relationships and domestic violence.[2][12] This work was then further studied in the contexts of parent-child relationships, sexual exploitation, and more. Patrick Carnes described trauma bonding as "the misuse of fear, excitement, sexual feelings, and sexual physiology to entangle another person."[13] Traumatic bonding is also described as "[a] strong emotional attachment between an abused person and his or her abuser, formed as a result of the cycle of violence."[14] Carnes also studied traumatic bonding theory in the context of betrayal, which involved the exploitation of the victim's trust and/or sense of power by the abuser.[15]在 1980 年代，Donald G. Dutton 和 Susan L. Painter 在虐待关系和家庭暴力的背景下探索了创伤性结合理论的概念。[2][12] 然后在亲子关系、 性剥削等背景下进一步研究了这项工作。 帕特里克·卡恩斯 （Patrick Carnes） 将创伤纽带描述为“滥用恐惧 、 兴奋 、 性感觉和性生理学来纠缠另一个人”。[13] 创伤性联系也被描述为“受虐待者与施虐者之间因暴力循环而形成的强烈情感依恋”。[14] 卡恩斯还研究了背叛背景下的创伤性结合理论，其中涉及施虐者对受害者信任和/或权力感的剥削 。[15]

Establishment  建立[edit]
Trauma bonds are formed in abused-abuser and/or victim-victimizer dynamics. A victim can form a trauma bond with an abuser in the presence of a perceived threat from the abuser. Trauma bonds also form when the victim believes the abuser will follow through with a threat, when the victim perceives some form of kindness from the abuser, when the victim is isolated from outsider perspectives, and when the victim perceives a lack of ability or capacity to leave the situation.[16]创伤纽带是在虐待者-施虐者和/或受害者-受害者动态中形成的。当施虐者感知到威胁时，受害者可以与施虐者形成创伤纽带。当受害者相信施虐者会继续威胁时，当受害者感知到施虐者的某种形式的善意时，当受害者与外界的观点隔离时，以及当受害者认为缺乏能力或能力离开这种情况时，也会形成创伤纽带。[16]
The first incident of abuse is often perceived as an anomaly, a one-off instance occurring at the beginning of a seemingly healthy and positive relationship that is often not very severe. Furthermore, the expression of affection and care by the abuser following the incident pacifies the victim and instills in them the belief that the abuse is not recurring. However, repeated instances of abuse and maltreatment later generate a cognitive shift in the victim's mind: that preventing the abuse is not in their power. When the inability to escape the abuse becomes apparent, the emotional trauma bond is already strong.[12]第一次虐待事件通常被认为是一种异常现象，是一次性发生在看似健康和积极的关系开始时，通常不是很严重。此外，施虐者在事件发生后表达的爱意和关怀可以安抚受害者，并向他们灌输虐待不会再次发生的信念。然而，反复发生的虐待和虐待事件后来在受害者的思想中产生了认知转变：防止虐待不是他们有能力的。当无法摆脱虐待变得明显时，情感创伤纽带已经很牢固了。[12]
Two main factors facilitate forming and continuing a trauma bond: a power imbalance and intermittent reinforcement.[17][18]两个主要因素有助于形成和延续创伤纽带：权力不平衡和间歇性强化。[17] [18]

Power imbalance  功率不平衡[edit]
For a trauma bond to persist, a power differential must exist between the abuser and the victim such that the abuser is in a position of power and authority and the victim is not. Inequality in power can produce pathologies in individuals that can fortify the trauma bond. Upon experiencing intermittent punishment from the abuser or dominant individual, who is in a position of high power, the victim may internalize the abuser's perception of themselves.[2] This may result in a tendency for the victim to blame themselves in situations of violence perpetrated by the abuser, which can negatively impact the victim's self-concept.
为了使创伤纽带持续存在，施虐者和受害者之间必须存在权力差异，以便施虐者处于权力和权威的位置，而受害者则不然。权力不平等会在个人身上产生病态，从而加强创伤纽带。在经历施虐者或处于高位的支配者的间歇性惩罚后，受害者可能会内化施虐者对自己的看法。[2] 这可能会导致受害者在施虐者实施暴力的情况下倾向于责备自己，从而对受害者的自我概念产生负面影响。A negative self-appraisal can maximize the emotional dependency on the abuser and the cyclical nature of this dependency. Negative self-concept can eventually lead to the formation of a strong emotional bond from the victim to the abuser (i.e., to the person who is in a position of power and authority from the person who is not). Furthermore, physical, emotional, and sexual abuse can be used to maintain the power differential. This dynamic is also maintained via the interaction of the abuser's sense of power and the victim's sense of powerlessness and subjugation.[2]消极的自我评价可以最大限度地增加对施虐者的情感依赖以及这种依赖的周期性。消极的自我概念最终会导致受害者与施虐者（即与非施虐者之间处于权力和权威地位的人）之间形成强烈的情感纽带。此外，身体、情感和性虐待可以用来维持权力差异。这种动态也通过施虐者的权力感和受害者的无力感和征服感的相互作用来维持。[2]

Intermittent reinforcement间歇性加固[edit]
Intermittent reinforcement of rewards and punishments is crucial to establishing and maintaining a trauma bond. In trauma bonding, the abuser intermittently maltreats the victim through physical, verbal, emotional, and/or psychological abuse. This maltreatment is interspersed with positive behaviors like expressing affection and care, showing kindness, giving the victim gifts, and promising not to repeat the abuse. Alternating and sporadic periods of good and bad treatment serve to reinforce the victim intermittently.[2]间歇性强化奖励和惩罚对于建立和维持创伤纽带至关重要。在创伤联系中，施虐者通过身体、言语、情感和/或心理虐待间歇性地虐待受害者。这种虐待中穿插着积极的行为，例如表达爱意和关怀、表现出善意、给受害者礼物以及承诺不再重复虐待。交替和零星的好和坏待遇会间歇性地强化受害者。[2]
The pervasiveness of learning something through intermittent reinforcement can be elucidated by drawing from learning theory and the behaviorist perspective. In the presence of an aversive stimulus, reinforcement through rewards in unpredictable ways is a key component of learning. When the learner is unable to predict when they will get the reward, learning is maximized. Similarly, the intermittent expressions of affection and care are unexpected, and the inability to predict them makes them more sought after. Intermittent reinforcement produces behavioral patterns that are tough to terminate. Thus, they develop incredibly strong emotional bonds.[2]通过间歇性强化学习某事的普遍性可以通过学习理论和行为主义的观点来阐明。在存在厌恶刺激的情况下，通过以不可预测的方式奖励进行强化是学习的关键组成部分。当学习者无法预测他们何时会获得奖励时，学习就会最大化。同样，断断续续的爱意和关怀表达也是出乎意料的，无法预测也让它们更加受到追捧。间歇性强化会产生难以终止的行为模式。因此，他们建立了令人难以置信的强烈情感纽带。[2]

Maintenance  保养[edit]
A trauma bond can be maintained by keeping the power imbalance and the intermittency of abuse intact.
通过保持权力不平衡和虐待的间歇性完好无损，可以维持创伤纽带。Trauma bonds can also be maintained if the victim is financially dependent on the abuser or has some investment in the relationship, such as a child with the abuser.[6]如果受害者在经济上依赖施虐者或对这种关系有一些投资，例如与施虐者的孩子，也可以维持创伤纽带。[6]
Cognitive dissonance theory can also explain the maintenance of a trauma bond; it postulates that when individuals experience a conflict between their beliefs and actions, they are motivated to reduce or eliminate the incongruence to minimize the psychological discomfort. In this vein, victims may distort their cognition about the trauma and violence of the relationship to maintain a positive view of the relationship. This can involve rationalizing the abuser's behavior, justifications, minimizing the impact of the abuser's violence, and/or self-blaming.[6]认知失调理论也可以解释创伤纽带的维持;它假设，当个人经历他们的信念和行为之间的冲突时，他们有动力减少或消除不一致，以尽量减少心理不适。在这种精神下，受害者可能会扭曲他们对关系的创伤和暴力的认知，以保持对关系的积极看法。这可能涉及合理化施虐者的行为、理由、尽量减少施虐者暴力的影响和/或自责。[6]
Furthermore, research shows that the memory of instances wherein abuse was experienced is dissociated or state-dependent, meaning that the memories of abuse only fully resurface when the situation is similar in intensity and experience to the original situation of terror.[19]此外，研究表明，遭受虐待的记忆是分离的或依赖于状态的，这意味着只有当情况的强度和经历与最初的恐怖情况相似时，虐待的记忆才会完全重新出现。[19]
If and when the victim finally decides to leave the abusive relationship, the immediate relief from the traumatizing violence will begin to abate, and the underlying, deep attachment formed from intermittent reinforcement will begin to surface. This current period of vulnerability and emotional exhaustion will likely trigger memories of when the abuser was temporarily affectionate and caring. In the desire to receive that affection once more, the victim may try to return to the abusive relationship.[12][2]如果受害者最终决定离开虐待关系，那么从创伤性暴力中得到的直接缓解将开始减弱，而间歇性强化形成的潜在的、深层的依恋将开始浮出水面。当前的脆弱和情绪疲惫的时期可能会引发施虐者暂时深情和关怀的记忆。为了再次获得这种感情，受害者可能会试图回到虐待关系中。[12][2]
Strong social support, however, can be a protective factor in preserving the victim's functioning and providing a buffer in traumatic situations.[20]然而，强有力的社会支持可以成为保护受害者功能并在创伤情况下提供缓冲的保护因素。[20]

The role of attachment  依恋的作用[edit]
John Bowlby maintained that secure attachment was an evolutionary human need that superseded even the need for food and reproduction.[2] Attachment has been explored in depth in caregiver-child dynamics, but recent research has shown that the principles that explain attachment between caregivers and infants can also explain attachment throughout one's life span, specifically in the context of intimate relationships and romantic bonds.[21]约翰·鲍尔比坚持认为，安全依恋是人类进化的一种需求，甚至取代了对食物和繁殖的需求。[2] 依恋在照顾者与儿童的动态中得到了深入的探讨，但最近的研究表明，解释照顾者和婴儿之间依恋的原则也可以解释一个人一生中的依恋，特别是在亲密关系和浪漫纽带的背景下。[21]
Attachment bonds formed during early life lay the foundation for interpersonal relationships, interactions, personality characteristics, and mental health in the future.[22] Infants usually form attachments with their parents or immediate caregivers. Harlow's research on monkeys shows that infant monkeys form attachment bonds even with abusive mothers (in the experimental setup, the abusive 'mother' was a monkey made out of fabric who delivered mild shocks to the infant monkey or flung the infant monkey across the arena). 
早年形成的依恋纽带为未来的人际关系、互动、性格特征和心理健康奠定了基础。[22] 婴儿通常与父母或直接照顾者形成依恋。 哈洛对猴子的研究表明，即使与虐待的母亲，幼猴也会形成依恋纽带（在实验设置中，虐待的“母亲”是一只由织物制成的猴子，它对幼猴进行轻微的电击或将幼猴扔过竞技场）。These findings also apply to human attachment bonds. Even in situations where immediate caregivers are abusive, human infants still tend to attach to them; rejection from a caregiver only enhances the efforts to increase proximity to them and establish an attachment bond with them.[19]
Furthermore, in situations of danger, humans seek increased attachment. When ordinary pathways of attachment are unavailable, people tend to turn to their abusers. This leads to strong bonds and deep emotional connections with abusers. This attachment—both to abusive caregivers and to other abusers in the absence of a main caregiver—may be adaptive in the short run as it may aid survival. But in the long run, this attachment is maladaptive and can lay the foundation for, increase vulnerability to, and even directly lead to trauma bonding.

Stockholm syndrome[edit]
The concept of trauma bonding is often conflated with Stockholm syndrome. Although there are overarching similarities between the two, especially in the context of developing an emotional bond with one's abuser, trauma bonding and Stockholm syndrome are distinct from one another. The main difference is the direction of the relationship.[1]
In other words, in the case of Stockholm syndrome, the emotional connection is reciprocal, such that the abuser also appears to develop an emotional connection towards the abused and harbor positive feelings for the abused, in addition to the abused developing an emotional bond with the abuser.[1]

In abusive relationships[edit]


Although the victim may disclose the abuse, the trauma bond means that the victim may wish to receive comfort from the very person who abused them.


PACE UK[23]
Unhealthy, or traumatic, bonding occurs between people in an abusive relationship. The bond is stronger for people who have grown up in abusive households and who believe abuse to be a normal part of relationships.[13] On the psychometric scale for Stockholm syndrome, the three main components are: justifying an abuser through cognitive distortions, damage, ongoing psychological effects of abuse, and love.[6]
Initially, the abuser is inconsistent in approach, increasing in intensity over time. As the bond progresses, it may become more difficult for victims to leave abusers with whom they have bonded.[13]
Fear, children, and financial constraints may be factors preventing victims from leaving abusive relationships.[24]

Battered women[edit]
Initial research about battered women held the view that a victim's return to an abusive relationship was an indicator of a flawed personality and, more specifically, masochism.[12] However, this view was perpetuated by the 'just-world fallacy', the cognitive bias towards the idea that people "get what is coming for them". The tendency to victim-blame arises from the belief that the world is a just and fair place where the victim is seen as deserving of any negative consequences. However, research on battered women and research on traumatic bonding have shown that that is not the case. In terms of battered women's decision to stay in or return to an abusive relationship, many factors are at play, ranging from family history and role expectations to access to resources to the dynamics of the relationship itself.[12] A crucial part of the relationship's dynamic is the existence of a trauma bond. Maltreatment interspersed with periods of kindness aids in the formation of a trauma bond that makes the victim harbor positive feelings towards the abuser.[12]
Among battered women, a three-phase process can explain the intermittent reward-punishment cycle. During phase one, there is a gradual increase in tension, followed by an "explosive battering incident" in phase two, which is then followed by a peaceful expression of love and affection from the abuser during phase three. These phases' recurring and cyclical nature gives rise to a trauma bond.[2]

Sex trafficking[edit]
Trauma bonds are extremely common in situations of sex trafficking, child grooming, commercial sexual exploitation of children (CSEC), and pimp-prostitute relationships.

Grooming[edit]
Child grooming involves establishing and maintaining trauma bonds between the child and the abuser. Along with the factors of power imbalance and intermittent reinforcement that contribute to trauma bonding, child grooming also necessitates gaining the trust of those around the child. Grooming also involves gaining the child's trust while simultaneously violating their boundaries. Treats and trips are used as bribes to both gain access to the child as well as ensure that they comply.[25] Intense attachments coupled with cognitive distortions deepen the bond.
A 2019 case study explores the life of one individual who was groomed. The victim's perception of the abuser as a benefactor, a substitute parent, and a mind controller all contributed to the development of a traumatic bond between the victim and the abuser.[25] In terms of being a benefactor, the abuser in this case study went above and beyond to give the victim what they needed. From getting the victim a job to gifting them a plot of land for their first house, the abuser was always present as a benefactor. The abuser also acted as a substitute parent, advising and offering emotional support in times of crisis. The roles of the abuser as a benefactor and substitute parent constituted the good treatment necessary to establish a trauma bond. In contrast, the abuser's role as a mind controller involved controlling and dominating tendencies that emulated being brainwashed.[25] This combination of perceptions established a traumatic bond that the victim found incredibly difficult to break because rejecting the emotional connection as a whole would also involve rejecting the perks and benefits—the trips, the gifts, the treats, the confidante, and the caretaker.
Child grooming can be understood from a developmental perspective as well, and the relationship between the victim and the abuser evolves across the lifespan. Grooming starts when the child is extremely young—the trust of the child and the family is acquired. The child is given immense attention and is showered with gifts.[25] As the individual matures and enters adolescence, the abuser becomes a confidante and a benefactor. In the case study mentioned previously, the abuser gave the victim career advice, picked him up, and dropped him off at school. Then, at the onset of adulthood, the abuser provided the victim with land to build their home and became the person the victim brought their partner home to. As the victim's developmental needs evolved, so did the abuser's response, such that the only thing constant was the victim's need for affection. In other words, the abuser was "able to capitalize on [the victim's] relational needs" until the victim was able to meet those needs in other ways.[25]

Commercial sexual exploitation of children (CSEC)[edit]
The commercial sexual exploitation of children (CSEC) can cause debilitating physical and psychological trauma. Along with causing functional impairments, it can amplify risk-taking behaviors and increase impulse dysregulation, further compromising the child's ability to conceptualize, comprehend, establish, and maintain boundaries. This can lead to confusion regarding what safety, affection, intimacy, and kindness entail, resulting in the formation of a trauma bond with the abuser or trafficker that is based on skewed perceptions of safety and kindness.[1] The trauma bond deepens and strengthens when isolation and threats to survival increase, forcing the victim to depend almost entirely on the abuser for survival and protection. This increased emotional dependence on the abuser normalizes the emotional violence experienced by the victim at the hands of the abuser, and gradually, the victim develops a sense of trust and safety, albeit skewed, towards the abuser.[1]

Trauma-coercive bond[edit]
Trauma bonding thrives in the presence of a power imbalance and intermittent reward/punishment behavior. Trauma-coercive bonding, on the other hand, has two additional elements: social isolation and the perceived inability to escape the situation. Since these two elements are crucial to the experiences of victims of CSEC, their bonds with their abusers are better described as trauma-coercive bonds rather than simply as trauma bonds. The element of coercion concreted by social isolation and the perceived inability to escape makes the trauma bond more complex and far more deeply rooted.[1] The use of coercive trauma bonding encapsulates the psycho-social dynamics of a relationship between a victim and a perpetrator of CSEC.

Intimate partner violence (IPV)[edit]
IPV has been defined as physical, sexual, psychological, economic, or stalking abuse, both concrete and menaced, perpetuated by current or ex-partners. Trauma bonding is used to solidify this type of relationship by rationalizing and/or minimizing a violent partner's behavior, self-blame, and reporting love in the context of fear.

Parent-child relationships[edit]
Trauma bonds in parent-child or caregiver-child dynamics can be borne from abuse, neglect, or incestuous relationships.[26]

Abuse and/or neglect[edit]
Children of dismissive caregivers or cruel caregivers can develop insecure attachments, which can be very dysfunctional. Inconsistencies in reward and punishment (i.e., intermittent reinforcement of good and bad treatment) can highlight the affection the child receives from the parent, forcing a split between the abuse and the kindness such that the child seeks to form an overall positive view of the caregiver and thus focuses only on the affection and kindness they receive.[15][8] Overall, a trauma bond develops such that the child's sense of self is derived from their emotional dependence on the authority figure, who, in this case, is the parent and/or caregiver.

Incest[edit]
Incestuous relationships between parents and children cultivate trauma bonds similar to those prevalent in victims of sex trafficking. All participants in a 1994 study by Jane Kay Hedberg on trauma in adult incest survivors demonstrated some trauma bonding with their abusers.[27] There was a positive correlation between the pervasiveness of the trauma bond and the amount of contact the victim or the victim's close family members had with the abuser: those who self-reported less pervasive trauma also reported sustained contact with their abuser, while those who self-reported more pervasive trauma demonstrated an active avoidance of maintaining a relationship with their abuser. In incestuous parent-child dynamics, the study found that maintaining an unhealthy relationship with the abuser contributes to trauma and sustains the trauma bond.[27] However, Hedberg cautions against generalizing findings from the study since the sample was small (n = 11) and wasn't representative of the general population of incest survivors.[footnote 1]
This aligns with the idea that trauma bonds are toxic and difficult to leave due to the inherent power imbalance, which, in parent-child relationships, is even more pervasive than in other situations. Incestuous relationships also have an added layer of betrayal trauma, which arises from the exploitation of the victim's trust, resulting in a feeling of betrayal.[22]

Military (tours of duty)[edit]
Trauma bonds can develop in military settings. The literature demonstrates this specifically in the context of tours of duty, wherein military personnel are deployed in hostile environments or areas of combat. A 2019 study exploring this specific phenomenon sought to understand the traumatic bond developed between Japanese soldiers and Korean 'comfort women' in the midst of World War II.[28] The trauma, in this case, was two-fold: not only did the trauma bond develop in an abused-abuser dynamic, but the trauma itself was also a result of and was perpetuated by the war. While the relationships provided the Japanese soldiers with emotional relief and an escape from the violence of the war and the tyranny of the higher-ranking officers, they also provided the Korean 'comfort women' with much-desired protection and kindness from the soldiers.[28]
Soldiers would behave aggressively and violently towards the 'comfort women' and often sexually exploit them. They would use intimidation tactics to assert dominance and foster coercion. However, this abuse would be interspersed with kindness and empathy from the soldiers, whose moods and subsequent behavior and interactions were highly contingent on the time and context of the ongoing war.[28] Nonetheless, the intermittent kindness allowed the formation and maintenance of a trauma bond. Intermittent rewards were sometimes also more tangible, in the form of food, outings, and physical protection. However, protection and emotional support were pivotal in maintaining the trauma bonds and far more important than food and outings. The Korean 'comfort women' eventually came to be emotionally dependent on the Japanese soldiers and began to relate this dependence with their own sense of power, thereby establishing a trauma bond that, for some, persisted even after the war was over.[28]

Outcomes[edit]
Trauma bonding has several short-term and long-term impacts on the abused. It can force people to stay in abusive relationships, negatively affect self-image and self-esteem, perpetuate transgenerational cycles of abuse, and result in adverse mental health outcomes like an increased likelihood of developing depression and/or bipolar disorder.[9][8][5][1]

Staying in abusive relationships[edit]
Owing to the debilitating psychological manipulation involved in the development of a trauma bond, abused people tend to stay in abusive relationships, mainly because the perceived consequences of leaving the relationship seem far more negative than the consequences of staying in the abusive relationship.[6][2]
In such relationships, maltreatment is often interspersed with fragments of solace and peace that involve the expression of love, kindness, affection, and/or general friendliness from the abuser towards the abused.[6] This intermittent reinforcement of a reward (here, the abuser's love and kindness) amidst all the abuse becomes what the victim begins to hold on to. Thus, victims tend to become emotionally dependent on the abuser and construct the belief that their survival is contingent upon receiving the abuser's love.[6] Victims thereby begin to formulate their sense of identity (a form of self) around receiving the abuser's affection, which points to what could be gaslighting. Kindness and affection from the abuser amidst the abuse become a focal point for the victim's emotional dependence. This dependency is characterized by the belief that their survival is contingent on the abuser's love and affection, leading victims to construct their sense of identity and self-worth around this dynamic.[29] Additionally, the provision of intermittent love and affection makes the victim cling to the hope that things can change.[11] Furthermore, self-blame, the fear of social stigma and embarrassment, the fear of loneliness in the absence of a partner, and the lack of or poor social support from other family and friends also contribute to individuals remaining in abusive relationships.[11]

Perpetuation of transgenerational cycles of abuse[edit]
People who have experienced trauma and traumatic bonds can, knowingly or unknowingly, repeat the cycle of abuse. In other words, victims who were traumatically bonded with abusers may grow to become abusers themselves. The abuse that victims inflict may or may not involve trauma bonding.[9]
For instance, in a 2018 study on convicted child murderers, researchers found that caregivers who committed child homicide (murdered their child or care receiver) had experienced traumatic experiences and had trauma bonds with abusers in their early lives.[8] Individuals with cruel and/or dismissive caregivers are likely to develop insecure attachments that result in a host of problems, including emotion deregulation and an attitude of confusion towards the caregiver, who becomes a source of comfort as well as fear. These adverse attachments can manifest in an individual's relationship with their own children as well. Attachment issues and painful memories of trauma bonds with their own caregivers can be triggered, and individuals may demonstrate heightened and disproportionate aggression toward their child, some culminating in homicide.[8] In this study, participants experienced physical abuse, sexual abuse, a lack of protection from external dangers, abandonment, emotional rejection, and more from their caregivers. Nonetheless, participants expressed unconditional love towards their caregivers, justified by wanting to maintain an overall positive view of them.[8] In their continued efforts to form an emotional connection, a trauma bond was fostered. These experiences had a severe negative impact on their relationship and bonding with their own children, contributing to "affectionless, unempathetic interpersonal behavior" that inflated aggressive and violent tendencies triggered by vulnerabilities.[8]

Neurophysiological outcomes[edit]
The experience of being in a trauma bond can have adverse neurological and neurophysiological outcomes. The body of the victim of a trauma bond is in a perpetual 'fight-or-flight' response state, which can increase cortisol levels that can have a cascading effect and trigger other hormones. 
Persistent, chronic stress can also hamper the cellular response in the body, thereby negatively impacting immunity, organ health, mood, energy levels, and more.[1] In the long run, this can cause epigenetic changes as well. Furthermore, a study conducted in 2015 found that establishing a trauma bond in infancy is also linked with amygdala dysfunction, neurobehavioral deficits, and increased vulnerability to psychiatric disorders later on in life.[30] Psychological abuse is correlated with sleep-related impairments. Disruption in sleep patterns leads to adverse neurophysiological problems, such as an increase in anxiety and irritability. For victims of psychological abuse, the increase in cortisol affects the brain in such a manner that it allows the trauma bonding to be strengthened.[31]

Adverse mental health outcomes[edit]
Trauma bonding is linked to several adverse mental health and well-being outcomes. Due to the abuse and the emotional dependence on their abusers, victims tend to develop an incredibly negative self-image. "Controlling, restricting, degrading, isolating, or dominating" abuse has a crippling effect on the self-image and self-esteem of the abused, and this psychological abuse is far more dangerous than physical abuse.[5] In a 2010 study on battered women labeling themselves as "stupid", researchers found that victims who felt like they allowed themselves to be mistreated and victims who stayed in abusive relationships labeled themselves as "stupid" for doing so.[10] This further contributes to a negative self-image and the maintenance of low self-esteem, both of which foster a poor self-concept, which, in turn, adversely impacts mental well-being. The same was observed in the case study mentioned previously on grooming.[25]
Trauma bonding can also lead to dissociative symptoms that could be a self-preservation and/or coping mechanism. Neurobiological changes can also affect brain development and hamper learning. The internalization of psychological manipulation and trauma can cause anxiety and increase the likelihood of engaging in risk-taking behaviors.[1] Furthermore, the isolation involved in trauma bonding can foster a generally skewed sense of trust, making victims vulnerable to situations that may retraumatize or revictimize them. Victims may also tend to either completely dismiss or minimize dangerous, damaging behaviors and violence around them.[1]
Trauma bonds in parent-child relationships (wherein the child is the victim and the parent is the abuser) can also lead to depressive symptoms later in life.[9] In a 2017 study exploring this, it was found that an "affectionless control" parenting style, characterized by high protection and low care from parents, was a major predictor of depressive symptomology for the victim. In other words, the presence of poor parental bonding coupled with childhood trauma bonds increased the likelihood of the child developing depressive symptoms in the future. A negative self-image is formed when feelings of inadequacy and hopelessness persist and are reinforced by caregivers. Perpetual efforts to seek secure emotional attachments reap no rewards, and a trauma bond facilitates a negative core schema that influences perceptions and interactions throughout one's life.[9] This can give rise to mental health issues such as depression, bipolar disorder, mania, suicidality, and substance abuse that can be pervasive and lifelong.

005. Trauma bonds have severe detrimental effects on the victim. Some long-term impacts of trauma bonding include remaining in abusive relationships, adverse mental health outcomes like low self-esteem and negative self-image, an increased likelihood of depression and bipolar disorder, and perpetuating a generational cycle of abuse.[1][5][8][9] Victims who develop trauma bonds are often unable or unwilling to leave these relationships. Many abuse victims who experience trauma bonding return to the abusive relationship.[10][11]创伤纽带对受害者有严重的不利影响。创伤纽带的一些长期影响包括继续处于虐待关系中、不良的心理健康结果（如自卑和负面自我形象）、患抑郁症和双相情感障碍的可能性增加，以及使虐待的代际循环永久化。[1][5][8][9] 建立创伤纽带的受害者通常无法或不愿意离开这些关系。许多经历创伤联系的虐待受害者会回到虐待关系中。[10][11]

006. Context  上下文

007. In the 1980s, Donald G. Dutton and Susan L. Painter explored the concept of traumatic bonding theory in the context of abusive relationships and domestic violence.[2][12] This work was then further studied in the contexts of parent-child relationships, sexual exploitation, and more. Patrick Carnes described trauma bonding as "the misuse of fear, excitement, sexual feelings, and sexual physiology to entangle another person."[13] Traumatic bonding is also described as "[a] strong emotional attachment between an abused person and his or her abuser, formed as a result of the cycle of violence."[14] Carnes also studied traumatic bonding theory in the context of betrayal, which involved the exploitation of the victim's trust and/or sense of power by the abuser.[15]在 1980 年代，Donald G. Dutton 和 Susan L. Painter 在虐待关系和家庭暴力的背景下探索了创伤性结合理论的概念。[2][12] 然后在亲子关系、 性剥削等背景下进一步研究了这项工作。 帕特里克·卡恩斯 （Patrick Carnes） 将创伤纽带描述为“滥用恐惧 、 兴奋 、 性感觉和性生理学来纠缠另一个人”。[13] 创伤性联系也被描述为“受虐待者与施虐者之间因暴力循环而形成的强烈情感依恋”。[14] 卡恩斯还研究了背叛背景下的创伤性结合理论，其中涉及施虐者对受害者信任和/或权力感的剥削 。[15]

008. Establishment  建立

009. Trauma bonds are formed in abused-abuser and/or victim-victimizer dynamics. A victim can form a trauma bond with an abuser in the presence of a perceived threat from the abuser. Trauma bonds also form when the victim believes the abuser will follow through with a threat, when the victim perceives some form of kindness from the abuser, when the victim is isolated from outsider perspectives, and when the victim perceives a lack of ability or capacity to leave the situation.[16]创伤纽带是在虐待者-施虐者和/或受害者-受害者动态中形成的。当施虐者感知到威胁时，受害者可以与施虐者形成创伤纽带。当受害者相信施虐者会继续威胁时，当受害者感知到施虐者的某种形式的善意时，当受害者与外界的观点隔离时，以及当受害者认为缺乏能力或能力离开这种情况时，也会形成创伤纽带。[16]
The first incident of abuse is often perceived as an anomaly, a one-off instance occurring at the beginning of a seemingly healthy and positive relationship that is often not very severe. Furthermore, the expression of affection and care by the abuser following the incident pacifies the victim and instills in them the belief that the abuse is not recurring. However, repeated instances of abuse and maltreatment later generate a cognitive shift in the victim's mind: that preventing the abuse is not in their power. When the inability to escape the abuse becomes apparent, the emotional trauma bond is already strong.[12]第一次虐待事件通常被认为是一种异常现象，是一次性发生在看似健康和积极的关系开始时，通常不是很严重。此外，施虐者在事件发生后表达的爱意和关怀可以安抚受害者，并向他们灌输虐待不会再次发生的信念。然而，反复发生的虐待和虐待事件后来在受害者的思想中产生了认知转变：防止虐待不是他们有能力的。当无法摆脱虐待变得明显时，情感创伤纽带已经很牢固了。[12]
Two main factors facilitate forming and continuing a trauma bond: a power imbalance and intermittent reinforcement.[17][18]两个主要因素有助于形成和延续创伤纽带：权力不平衡和间歇性强化。[17] [18]

Power imbalance  功率不平衡[edit]
For a trauma bond to persist, a power differential must exist between the abuser and the victim such that the abuser is in a position of power and authority and the victim is not. Inequality in power can produce pathologies in individuals that can fortify the trauma bond. Upon experiencing intermittent punishment from the abuser or dominant individual, who is in a position of high power, the victim may internalize the abuser's perception of themselves.[2] This may result in a tendency for the victim to blame themselves in situations of violence perpetrated by the abuser, which can negatively impact the victim's self-concept.
为了使创伤纽带持续存在，施虐者和受害者之间必须存在权力差异，以便施虐者处于权力和权威的位置，而受害者则不然。权力不平等会在个人身上产生病态，从而加强创伤纽带。在经历施虐者或处于高位的支配者的间歇性惩罚后，受害者可能会内化施虐者对自己的看法。[2] 这可能会导致受害者在施虐者实施暴力的情况下倾向于责备自己，从而对受害者的自我概念产生负面影响。A negative self-appraisal can maximize the emotional dependency on the abuser and the cyclical nature of this dependency. Negative self-concept can eventually lead to the formation of a strong emotional bond from the victim to the abuser (i.e., to the person who is in a position of power and authority from the person who is not). Furthermore, physical, emotional, and sexual abuse can be used to maintain the power differential. This dynamic is also maintained via the interaction of the abuser's sense of power and the victim's sense of powerlessness and subjugation.[2]消极的自我评价可以最大限度地增加对施虐者的情感依赖以及这种依赖的周期性。消极的自我概念最终会导致受害者与施虐者（即与非施虐者之间处于权力和权威地位的人）之间形成强烈的情感纽带。此外，身体、情感和性虐待可以用来维持权力差异。这种动态也通过施虐者的权力感和受害者的无力感和征服感的相互作用来维持。[2]

Intermittent reinforcement间歇性加固[edit]
Intermittent reinforcement of rewards and punishments is crucial to establishing and maintaining a trauma bond. In trauma bonding, the abuser intermittently maltreats the victim through physical, verbal, emotional, and/or psychological abuse. This maltreatment is interspersed with positive behaviors like expressing affection and care, showing kindness, giving the victim gifts, and promising not to repeat the abuse. Alternating and sporadic periods of good and bad treatment serve to reinforce the victim intermittently.[2]间歇性强化奖励和惩罚对于建立和维持创伤纽带至关重要。在创伤联系中，施虐者通过身体、言语、情感和/或心理虐待间歇性地虐待受害者。这种虐待中穿插着积极的行为，例如表达爱意和关怀、表现出善意、给受害者礼物以及承诺不再重复虐待。交替和零星的好和坏待遇会间歇性地强化受害者。[2]
The pervasiveness of learning something through intermittent reinforcement can be elucidated by drawing from learning theory and the behaviorist perspective. In the presence of an aversive stimulus, reinforcement through rewards in unpredictable ways is a key component of learning. When the learner is unable to predict when they will get the reward, learning is maximized. Similarly, the intermittent expressions of affection and care are unexpected, and the inability to predict them makes them more sought after. Intermittent reinforcement produces behavioral patterns that are tough to terminate. Thus, they develop incredibly strong emotional bonds.[2]通过间歇性强化学习某事的普遍性可以通过学习理论和行为主义的观点来阐明。在存在厌恶刺激的情况下，通过以不可预测的方式奖励进行强化是学习的关键组成部分。当学习者无法预测他们何时会获得奖励时，学习就会最大化。同样，断断续续的爱意和关怀表达也是出乎意料的，无法预测也让它们更加受到追捧。间歇性强化会产生难以终止的行为模式。因此，他们建立了令人难以置信的强烈情感纽带。[2]

Maintenance  保养[edit]
A trauma bond can be maintained by keeping the power imbalance and the intermittency of abuse intact.
通过保持权力不平衡和虐待的间歇性完好无损，可以维持创伤纽带。Trauma bonds can also be maintained if the victim is financially dependent on the abuser or has some investment in the relationship, such as a child with the abuser.[6]如果受害者在经济上依赖施虐者或对这种关系有一些投资，例如与施虐者的孩子，也可以维持创伤纽带。[6]
Cognitive dissonance theory can also explain the maintenance of a trauma bond; it postulates that when individuals experience a conflict between their beliefs and actions, they are motivated to reduce or eliminate the incongruence to minimize the psychological discomfort. In this vein, victims may distort their cognition about the trauma and violence of the relationship to maintain a positive view of the relationship. This can involve rationalizing the abuser's behavior, justifications, minimizing the impact of the abuser's violence, and/or self-blaming.[6]认知失调理论也可以解释创伤纽带的维持;它假设，当个人经历他们的信念和行为之间的冲突时，他们有动力减少或消除不一致，以尽量减少心理不适。在这种精神下，受害者可能会扭曲他们对关系的创伤和暴力的认知，以保持对关系的积极看法。这可能涉及合理化施虐者的行为、理由、尽量减少施虐者暴力的影响和/或自责。[6]
Furthermore, research shows that the memory of instances wherein abuse was experienced is dissociated or state-dependent, meaning that the memories of abuse only fully resurface when the situation is similar in intensity and experience to the original situation of terror.[19]此外，研究表明，遭受虐待的记忆是分离的或依赖于状态的，这意味着只有当情况的强度和经历与最初的恐怖情况相似时，虐待的记忆才会完全重新出现。[19]
If and when the victim finally decides to leave the abusive relationship, the immediate relief from the traumatizing violence will begin to abate, and the underlying, deep attachment formed from intermittent reinforcement will begin to surface. This current period of vulnerability and emotional exhaustion will likely trigger memories of when the abuser was temporarily affectionate and caring. In the desire to receive that affection once more, the victim may try to return to the abusive relationship.[12][2]如果受害者最终决定离开虐待关系，那么从创伤性暴力中得到的直接缓解将开始减弱，而间歇性强化形成的潜在的、深层的依恋将开始浮出水面。当前的脆弱和情绪疲惫的时期可能会引发施虐者暂时深情和关怀的记忆。为了再次获得这种感情，受害者可能会试图回到虐待关系中。[12][2]
Strong social support, however, can be a protective factor in preserving the victim's functioning and providing a buffer in traumatic situations.[20]然而，强有力的社会支持可以成为保护受害者功能并在创伤情况下提供缓冲的保护因素。[20]

The role of attachment  依恋的作用[edit]
John Bowlby maintained that secure attachment was an evolutionary human need that superseded even the need for food and reproduction.[2] Attachment has been explored in depth in caregiver-child dynamics, but recent research has shown that the principles that explain attachment between caregivers and infants can also explain attachment throughout one's life span, specifically in the context of intimate relationships and romantic bonds.[21]约翰·鲍尔比坚持认为，安全依恋是人类进化的一种需求，甚至取代了对食物和繁殖的需求。[2] 依恋在照顾者与儿童的动态中得到了深入的探讨，但最近的研究表明，解释照顾者和婴儿之间依恋的原则也可以解释一个人一生中的依恋，特别是在亲密关系和浪漫纽带的背景下。[21]
Attachment bonds formed during early life lay the foundation for interpersonal relationships, interactions, personality characteristics, and mental health in the future.[22] Infants usually form attachments with their parents or immediate caregivers. Harlow's research on monkeys shows that infant monkeys form attachment bonds even with abusive mothers (in the experimental setup, the abusive 'mother' was a monkey made out of fabric who delivered mild shocks to the infant monkey or flung the infant monkey across the arena). 
早年形成的依恋纽带为未来的人际关系、互动、性格特征和心理健康奠定了基础。[22] 婴儿通常与父母或直接照顾者形成依恋。 哈洛对猴子的研究表明，即使与虐待的母亲，幼猴也会形成依恋纽带（在实验设置中，虐待的“母亲”是一只由织物制成的猴子，它对幼猴进行轻微的电击或将幼猴扔过竞技场）。These findings also apply to human attachment bonds. Even in situations where immediate caregivers are abusive, human infants still tend to attach to them; rejection from a caregiver only enhances the efforts to increase proximity to them and establish an attachment bond with them.[19]
Furthermore, in situations of danger, humans seek increased attachment. When ordinary pathways of attachment are unavailable, people tend to turn to their abusers. This leads to strong bonds and deep emotional connections with abusers. This attachment—both to abusive caregivers and to other abusers in the absence of a main caregiver—may be adaptive in the short run as it may aid survival. But in the long run, this attachment is maladaptive and can lay the foundation for, increase vulnerability to, and even directly lead to trauma bonding.

Stockholm syndrome[edit]
The concept of trauma bonding is often conflated with Stockholm syndrome. Although there are overarching similarities between the two, especially in the context of developing an emotional bond with one's abuser, trauma bonding and Stockholm syndrome are distinct from one another. The main difference is the direction of the relationship.[1]
In other words, in the case of Stockholm syndrome, the emotional connection is reciprocal, such that the abuser also appears to develop an emotional connection towards the abused and harbor positive feelings for the abused, in addition to the abused developing an emotional bond with the abuser.[1]

Realms of existence[edit]
This section needs expansion with: how a victim will try to preserve an abusive relationship (accusing innocent people, confabulating personal injury stories, etc.). You can help by adding to it. (December 2021)
In abusive relationships[edit]


Although the victim may disclose the abuse, the trauma bond means that the victim may wish to receive comfort from the very person who abused them.


PACE UK[23]
Unhealthy, or traumatic, bonding occurs between people in an abusive relationship. The bond is stronger for people who have grown up in abusive households and who believe abuse to be a normal part of relationships.[13] On the psychometric scale for Stockholm syndrome, the three main components are: justifying an abuser through cognitive distortions, damage, ongoing psychological effects of abuse, and love.[6]
Initially, the abuser is inconsistent in approach, increasing in intensity over time. As the bond progresses, it may become more difficult for victims to leave abusers with whom they have bonded.[13]
Fear, children, and financial constraints may be factors preventing victims from leaving abusive relationships.[24]

Battered women[edit]
Initial research about battered women held the view that a victim's return to an abusive relationship was an indicator of a flawed personality and, more specifically, masochism.[12] However, this view was perpetuated by the 'just-world fallacy', the cognitive bias towards the idea that people "get what is coming for them". The tendency to victim-blame arises from the belief that the world is a just and fair place where the victim is seen as deserving of any negative consequences. However, research on battered women and research on traumatic bonding have shown that that is not the case. In terms of battered women's decision to stay in or return to an abusive relationship, many factors are at play, ranging from family history and role expectations to access to resources to the dynamics of the relationship itself.[12] A crucial part of the relationship's dynamic is the existence of a trauma bond. Maltreatment interspersed with periods of kindness aids in the formation of a trauma bond that makes the victim harbor positive feelings towards the abuser.[12]
Among battered women, a three-phase process can explain the intermittent reward-punishment cycle. During phase one, there is a gradual increase in tension, followed by an "explosive battering incident" in phase two, which is then followed by a peaceful expression of love and affection from the abuser during phase three. These phases' recurring and cyclical nature gives rise to a trauma bond.[2]

Sex trafficking[edit]
Trauma bonds are extremely common in situations of sex trafficking, child grooming, commercial sexual exploitation of children (CSEC), and pimp-prostitute relationships.

Grooming[edit]
Child grooming involves establishing and maintaining trauma bonds between the child and the abuser. Along with the factors of power imbalance and intermittent reinforcement that contribute to trauma bonding, child grooming also necessitates gaining the trust of those around the child. Grooming also involves gaining the child's trust while simultaneously violating their boundaries. Treats and trips are used as bribes to both gain access to the child as well as ensure that they comply.[25] Intense attachments coupled with cognitive distortions deepen the bond.
A 2019 case study explores the life of one individual who was groomed. The victim's perception of the abuser as a benefactor, a substitute parent, and a mind controller all contributed to the development of a traumatic bond between the victim and the abuser.[25] In terms of being a benefactor, the abuser in this case study went above and beyond to give the victim what they needed. From getting the victim a job to gifting them a plot of land for their first house, the abuser was always present as a benefactor. The abuser also acted as a substitute parent, advising and offering emotional support in times of crisis. The roles of the abuser as a benefactor and substitute parent constituted the good treatment necessary to establish a trauma bond. In contrast, the abuser's role as a mind controller involved controlling and dominating tendencies that emulated being brainwashed.[25] This combination of perceptions established a traumatic bond that the victim found incredibly difficult to break because rejecting the emotional connection as a whole would also involve rejecting the perks and benefits—the trips, the gifts, the treats, the confidante, and the caretaker.
Child grooming can be understood from a developmental perspective as well, and the relationship between the victim and the abuser evolves across the lifespan. Grooming starts when the child is extremely young—the trust of the child and the family is acquired. The child is given immense attention and is showered with gifts.[25] As the individual matures and enters adolescence, the abuser becomes a confidante and a benefactor. In the case study mentioned previously, the abuser gave the victim career advice, picked him up, and dropped him off at school. Then, at the onset of adulthood, the abuser provided the victim with land to build their home and became the person the victim brought their partner home to. As the victim's developmental needs evolved, so did the abuser's response, such that the only thing constant was the victim's need for affection. In other words, the abuser was "able to capitalize on [the victim's] relational needs" until the victim was able to meet those needs in other ways.[25]

Commercial sexual exploitation of children (CSEC)[edit]
The commercial sexual exploitation of children (CSEC) can cause debilitating physical and psychological trauma. Along with causing functional impairments, it can amplify risk-taking behaviors and increase impulse dysregulation, further compromising the child's ability to conceptualize, comprehend, establish, and maintain boundaries. This can lead to confusion regarding what safety, affection, intimacy, and kindness entail, resulting in the formation of a trauma bond with the abuser or trafficker that is based on skewed perceptions of safety and kindness.[1] The trauma bond deepens and strengthens when isolation and threats to survival increase, forcing the victim to depend almost entirely on the abuser for survival and protection. This increased emotional dependence on the abuser normalizes the emotional violence experienced by the victim at the hands of the abuser, and gradually, the victim develops a sense of trust and safety, albeit skewed, towards the abuser.[1]

Trauma-coercive bond[edit]
Trauma bonding thrives in the presence of a power imbalance and intermittent reward/punishment behavior. Trauma-coercive bonding, on the other hand, has two additional elements: social isolation and the perceived inability to escape the situation. Since these two elements are crucial to the experiences of victims of CSEC, their bonds with their abusers are better described as trauma-coercive bonds rather than simply as trauma bonds. The element of coercion concreted by social isolation and the perceived inability to escape makes the trauma bond more complex and far more deeply rooted.[1] The use of coercive trauma bonding encapsulates the psycho-social dynamics of a relationship between a victim and a perpetrator of CSEC.

Intimate partner violence (IPV)[edit]
IPV has been defined as physical, sexual, psychological, economic, or stalking abuse, both concrete and menaced, perpetuated by current or ex-partners. Trauma bonding is used to solidify this type of relationship by rationalizing and/or minimizing a violent partner's behavior, self-blame, and reporting love in the context of fear.

Parent-child relationships[edit]
Trauma bonds in parent-child or caregiver-child dynamics can be borne from abuse, neglect, or incestuous relationships.[26]

Abuse and/or neglect[edit]
Children of dismissive caregivers or cruel caregivers can develop insecure attachments, which can be very dysfunctional. Inconsistencies in reward and punishment (i.e., intermittent reinforcement of good and bad treatment) can highlight the affection the child receives from the parent, forcing a split between the abuse and the kindness such that the child seeks to form an overall positive view of the caregiver and thus focuses only on the affection and kindness they receive.[15][8] Overall, a trauma bond develops such that the child's sense of self is derived from their emotional dependence on the authority figure, who, in this case, is the parent and/or caregiver.

Incest[edit]
Incestuous relationships between parents and children cultivate trauma bonds similar to those prevalent in victims of sex trafficking. All participants in a 1994 study by Jane Kay Hedberg on trauma in adult incest survivors demonstrated some trauma bonding with their abusers.[27] There was a positive correlation between the pervasiveness of the trauma bond and the amount of contact the victim or the victim's close family members had with the abuser: those who self-reported less pervasive trauma also reported sustained contact with their abuser, while those who self-reported more pervasive trauma demonstrated an active avoidance of maintaining a relationship with their abuser. In incestuous parent-child dynamics, the study found that maintaining an unhealthy relationship with the abuser contributes to trauma and sustains the trauma bond.[27] However, Hedberg cautions against generalizing findings from the study since the sample was small (n = 11) and wasn't representative of the general population of incest survivors.[footnote 1]
This aligns with the idea that trauma bonds are toxic and difficult to leave due to the inherent power imbalance, which, in parent-child relationships, is even more pervasive than in other situations. Incestuous relationships also have an added layer of betrayal trauma, which arises from the exploitation of the victim's trust, resulting in a feeling of betrayal.[22]

Military (tours of duty)[edit]
Trauma bonds can develop in military settings. The literature demonstrates this specifically in the context of tours of duty, wherein military personnel are deployed in hostile environments or areas of combat. A 2019 study exploring this specific phenomenon sought to understand the traumatic bond developed between Japanese soldiers and Korean 'comfort women' in the midst of World War II.[28] The trauma, in this case, was two-fold: not only did the trauma bond develop in an abused-abuser dynamic, but the trauma itself was also a result of and was perpetuated by the war. While the relationships provided the Japanese soldiers with emotional relief and an escape from the violence of the war and the tyranny of the higher-ranking officers, they also provided the Korean 'comfort women' with much-desired protection and kindness from the soldiers.[28]
Soldiers would behave aggressively and violently towards the 'comfort women' and often sexually exploit them. They would use intimidation tactics to assert dominance and foster coercion. However, this abuse would be interspersed with kindness and empathy from the soldiers, whose moods and subsequent behavior and interactions were highly contingent on the time and context of the ongoing war.[28] Nonetheless, the intermittent kindness allowed the formation and maintenance of a trauma bond. Intermittent rewards were sometimes also more tangible, in the form of food, outings, and physical protection. However, protection and emotional support were pivotal in maintaining the trauma bonds and far more important than food and outings. The Korean 'comfort women' eventually came to be emotionally dependent on the Japanese soldiers and began to relate this dependence with their own sense of power, thereby establishing a trauma bond that, for some, persisted even after the war was over.[28]

Outcomes[edit]
Trauma bonding has several short-term and long-term impacts on the abused. It can force people to stay in abusive relationships, negatively affect self-image and self-esteem, perpetuate transgenerational cycles of abuse, and result in adverse mental health outcomes like an increased likelihood of developing depression and/or bipolar disorder.[9][8][5][1]

Staying in abusive relationships[edit]
Owing to the debilitating psychological manipulation involved in the development of a trauma bond, abused people tend to stay in abusive relationships, mainly because the perceived consequences of leaving the relationship seem far more negative than the consequences of staying in the abusive relationship.[6][2]
In such relationships, maltreatment is often interspersed with fragments of solace and peace that involve the expression of love, kindness, affection, and/or general friendliness from the abuser towards the abused.[6] This intermittent reinforcement of a reward (here, the abuser's love and kindness) amidst all the abuse becomes what the victim begins to hold on to. Thus, victims tend to become emotionally dependent on the abuser and construct the belief that their survival is contingent upon receiving the abuser's love.[6] Victims thereby begin to formulate their sense of identity (a form of self) around receiving the abuser's affection, which points to what could be gaslighting. Kindness and affection from the abuser amidst the abuse become a focal point for the victim's emotional dependence. This dependency is characterized by the belief that their survival is contingent on the abuser's love and affection, leading victims to construct their sense of identity and self-worth around this dynamic.[29] Additionally, the provision of intermittent love and affection makes the victim cling to the hope that things can change.[11] Furthermore, self-blame, the fear of social stigma and embarrassment, the fear of loneliness in the absence of a partner, and the lack of or poor social support from other family and friends also contribute to individuals remaining in abusive relationships.[11]

Perpetuation of transgenerational cycles of abuse[edit]
People who have experienced trauma and traumatic bonds can, knowingly or unknowingly, repeat the cycle of abuse. In other words, victims who were traumatically bonded with abusers may grow to become abusers themselves. The abuse that victims inflict may or may not involve trauma bonding.[9]
For instance, in a 2018 study on convicted child murderers, researchers found that caregivers who committed child homicide (murdered their child or care receiver) had experienced traumatic experiences and had trauma bonds with abusers in their early lives.[8] Individuals with cruel and/or dismissive caregivers are likely to develop insecure attachments that result in a host of problems, including emotion deregulation and an attitude of confusion towards the caregiver, who becomes a source of comfort as well as fear. These adverse attachments can manifest in an individual's relationship with their own children as well. Attachment issues and painful memories of trauma bonds with their own caregivers can be triggered, and individuals may demonstrate heightened and disproportionate aggression toward their child, some culminating in homicide.[8] In this study, participants experienced physical abuse, sexual abuse, a lack of protection from external dangers, abandonment, emotional rejection, and more from their caregivers. Nonetheless, participants expressed unconditional love towards their caregivers, justified by wanting to maintain an overall positive view of them.[8] In their continued efforts to form an emotional connection, a trauma bond was fostered. These experiences had a severe negative impact on their relationship and bonding with their own children, contributing to "affectionless, unempathetic interpersonal behavior" that inflated aggressive and violent tendencies triggered by vulnerabilities.[8]

Neurophysiological outcomes[edit]
The experience of being in a trauma bond can have adverse neurological and neurophysiological outcomes. The body of the victim of a trauma bond is in a perpetual 'fight-or-flight' response state, which can increase cortisol levels that can have a cascading effect and trigger other hormones. 
Persistent, chronic stress can also hamper the cellular response in the body, thereby negatively impacting immunity, organ health, mood, energy levels, and more.[1] In the long run, this can cause epigenetic changes as well. Furthermore, a study conducted in 2015 found that establishing a trauma bond in infancy is also linked with amygdala dysfunction, neurobehavioral deficits, and increased vulnerability to psychiatric disorders later on in life.[30] Psychological abuse is correlated with sleep-related impairments. Disruption in sleep patterns leads to adverse neurophysiological problems, such as an increase in anxiety and irritability. For victims of psychological abuse, the increase in cortisol affects the brain in such a manner that it allows the trauma bonding to be strengthened.[31]

Adverse mental health outcomes[edit]
Trauma bonding is linked to several adverse mental health and well-being outcomes. Due to the abuse and the emotional dependence on their abusers, victims tend to develop an incredibly negative self-image. "Controlling, restricting, degrading, isolating, or dominating" abuse has a crippling effect on the self-image and self-esteem of the abused, and this psychological abuse is far more dangerous than physical abuse.[5] In a 2010 study on battered women labeling themselves as "stupid", researchers found that victims who felt like they allowed themselves to be mistreated and victims who stayed in abusive relationships labeled themselves as "stupid" for doing so.[10] This further contributes to a negative self-image and the maintenance of low self-esteem, both of which foster a poor self-concept, which, in turn, adversely impacts mental well-being. The same was observed in the case study mentioned previously on grooming.[25]
Trauma bonding can also lead to dissociative symptoms that could be a self-preservation and/or coping mechanism. Neurobiological changes can also affect brain development and hamper learning. The internalization of psychological manipulation and trauma can cause anxiety and increase the likelihood of engaging in risk-taking behaviors.[1] Furthermore, the isolation involved in trauma bonding can foster a generally skewed sense of trust, making victims vulnerable to situations that may retraumatize or revictimize them. Victims may also tend to either completely dismiss or minimize dangerous, damaging behaviors and violence around them.[1]
Trauma bonds in parent-child relationships (wherein the child is the victim and the parent is the abuser) can also lead to depressive symptoms later in life.[9] In a 2017 study exploring this, it was found that an "affectionless control" parenting style, characterized by high protection and low care from parents, was a major predictor of depressive symptomology for the victim. In other words, the presence of poor parental bonding coupled with childhood trauma bonds increased the likelihood of the child developing depressive symptoms in the future. A negative self-image is formed when feelings of inadequacy and hopelessness persist and are reinforced by caregivers. Perpetual efforts to seek secure emotional attachments reap no rewards, and a trauma bond facilitates a negative core schema that influences perceptions and interactions throughout one's life.[9] This can give rise to mental health issues such as depression, bipolar disorder, mania, suicidality, and substance abuse that can be pervasive and lifelong.

010. The first incident of abuse is often perceived as an anomaly, a one-off instance occurring at the beginning of a seemingly healthy and positive relationship that is often not very severe. Furthermore, the expression of affection and care by the abuser following the incident pacifies the victim and instills in them the belief that the abuse is not recurring. However, repeated instances of abuse and maltreatment later generate a cognitive shift in the victim's mind: that preventing the abuse is not in their power. When the inability to escape the abuse becomes apparent, the emotional trauma bond is already strong.[12]第一次虐待事件通常被认为是一种异常现象，是一次性发生在看似健康和积极的关系开始时，通常不是很严重。此外，施虐者在事件发生后表达的爱意和关怀可以安抚受害者，并向他们灌输虐待不会再次发生的信念。然而，反复发生的虐待和虐待事件后来在受害者的思想中产生了认知转变：防止虐待不是他们有能力的。当无法摆脱虐待变得明显时，情感创伤纽带已经很牢固了。[12]
Two main factors facilitate forming and continuing a trauma bond: a power imbalance and intermittent reinforcement.[17][18]两个主要因素有助于形成和延续创伤纽带：权力不平衡和间歇性强化。[17] [18]

Power imbalance  功率不平衡[edit]
For a trauma bond to persist, a power differential must exist between the abuser and the victim such that the abuser is in a position of power and authority and the victim is not. Inequality in power can produce pathologies in individuals that can fortify the trauma bond. Upon experiencing intermittent punishment from the abuser or dominant individual, who is in a position of high power, the victim may internalize the abuser's perception of themselves.[2] This may result in a tendency for the victim to blame themselves in situations of violence perpetrated by the abuser, which can negatively impact the victim's self-concept.
为了使创伤纽带持续存在，施虐者和受害者之间必须存在权力差异，以便施虐者处于权力和权威的位置，而受害者则不然。权力不平等会在个人身上产生病态，从而加强创伤纽带。在经历施虐者或处于高位的支配者的间歇性惩罚后，受害者可能会内化施虐者对自己的看法。[2] 这可能会导致受害者在施虐者实施暴力的情况下倾向于责备自己，从而对受害者的自我概念产生负面影响。A negative self-appraisal can maximize the emotional dependency on the abuser and the cyclical nature of this dependency. Negative self-concept can eventually lead to the formation of a strong emotional bond from the victim to the abuser (i.e., to the person who is in a position of power and authority from the person who is not). Furthermore, physical, emotional, and sexual abuse can be used to maintain the power differential. This dynamic is also maintained via the interaction of the abuser's sense of power and the victim's sense of powerlessness and subjugation.[2]消极的自我评价可以最大限度地增加对施虐者的情感依赖以及这种依赖的周期性。消极的自我概念最终会导致受害者与施虐者（即与非施虐者之间处于权力和权威地位的人）之间形成强烈的情感纽带。此外，身体、情感和性虐待可以用来维持权力差异。这种动态也通过施虐者的权力感和受害者的无力感和征服感的相互作用来维持。[2]

Intermittent reinforcement间歇性加固[edit]
Intermittent reinforcement of rewards and punishments is crucial to establishing and maintaining a trauma bond. In trauma bonding, the abuser intermittently maltreats the victim through physical, verbal, emotional, and/or psychological abuse. This maltreatment is interspersed with positive behaviors like expressing affection and care, showing kindness, giving the victim gifts, and promising not to repeat the abuse. Alternating and sporadic periods of good and bad treatment serve to reinforce the victim intermittently.[2]间歇性强化奖励和惩罚对于建立和维持创伤纽带至关重要。在创伤联系中，施虐者通过身体、言语、情感和/或心理虐待间歇性地虐待受害者。这种虐待中穿插着积极的行为，例如表达爱意和关怀、表现出善意、给受害者礼物以及承诺不再重复虐待。交替和零星的好和坏待遇会间歇性地强化受害者。[2]
The pervasiveness of learning something through intermittent reinforcement can be elucidated by drawing from learning theory and the behaviorist perspective. In the presence of an aversive stimulus, reinforcement through rewards in unpredictable ways is a key component of learning. When the learner is unable to predict when they will get the reward, learning is maximized. Similarly, the intermittent expressions of affection and care are unexpected, and the inability to predict them makes them more sought after. Intermittent reinforcement produces behavioral patterns that are tough to terminate. Thus, they develop incredibly strong emotional bonds.[2]通过间歇性强化学习某事的普遍性可以通过学习理论和行为主义的观点来阐明。在存在厌恶刺激的情况下，通过以不可预测的方式奖励进行强化是学习的关键组成部分。当学习者无法预测他们何时会获得奖励时，学习就会最大化。同样，断断续续的爱意和关怀表达也是出乎意料的，无法预测也让它们更加受到追捧。间歇性强化会产生难以终止的行为模式。因此，他们建立了令人难以置信的强烈情感纽带。[2]

Maintenance  保养[edit]
A trauma bond can be maintained by keeping the power imbalance and the intermittency of abuse intact.
通过保持权力不平衡和虐待的间歇性完好无损，可以维持创伤纽带。Trauma bonds can also be maintained if the victim is financially dependent on the abuser or has some investment in the relationship, such as a child with the abuser.[6]如果受害者在经济上依赖施虐者或对这种关系有一些投资，例如与施虐者的孩子，也可以维持创伤纽带。[6]
Cognitive dissonance theory can also explain the maintenance of a trauma bond; it postulates that when individuals experience a conflict between their beliefs and actions, they are motivated to reduce or eliminate the incongruence to minimize the psychological discomfort. In this vein, victims may distort their cognition about the trauma and violence of the relationship to maintain a positive view of the relationship. This can involve rationalizing the abuser's behavior, justifications, minimizing the impact of the abuser's violence, and/or self-blaming.[6]认知失调理论也可以解释创伤纽带的维持;它假设，当个人经历他们的信念和行为之间的冲突时，他们有动力减少或消除不一致，以尽量减少心理不适。在这种精神下，受害者可能会扭曲他们对关系的创伤和暴力的认知，以保持对关系的积极看法。这可能涉及合理化施虐者的行为、理由、尽量减少施虐者暴力的影响和/或自责。[6]
Furthermore, research shows that the memory of instances wherein abuse was experienced is dissociated or state-dependent, meaning that the memories of abuse only fully resurface when the situation is similar in intensity and experience to the original situation of terror.[19]此外，研究表明，遭受虐待的记忆是分离的或依赖于状态的，这意味着只有当情况的强度和经历与最初的恐怖情况相似时，虐待的记忆才会完全重新出现。[19]
If and when the victim finally decides to leave the abusive relationship, the immediate relief from the traumatizing violence will begin to abate, and the underlying, deep attachment formed from intermittent reinforcement will begin to surface. This current period of vulnerability and emotional exhaustion will likely trigger memories of when the abuser was temporarily affectionate and caring. In the desire to receive that affection once more, the victim may try to return to the abusive relationship.[12][2]如果受害者最终决定离开虐待关系，那么从创伤性暴力中得到的直接缓解将开始减弱，而间歇性强化形成的潜在的、深层的依恋将开始浮出水面。当前的脆弱和情绪疲惫的时期可能会引发施虐者暂时深情和关怀的记忆。为了再次获得这种感情，受害者可能会试图回到虐待关系中。[12][2]
Strong social support, however, can be a protective factor in preserving the victim's functioning and providing a buffer in traumatic situations.[20]然而，强有力的社会支持可以成为保护受害者功能并在创伤情况下提供缓冲的保护因素。[20]

The role of attachment  依恋的作用[edit]
John Bowlby maintained that secure attachment was an evolutionary human need that superseded even the need for food and reproduction.[2] Attachment has been explored in depth in caregiver-child dynamics, but recent research has shown that the principles that explain attachment between caregivers and infants can also explain attachment throughout one's life span, specifically in the context of intimate relationships and romantic bonds.[21]约翰·鲍尔比坚持认为，安全依恋是人类进化的一种需求，甚至取代了对食物和繁殖的需求。[2] 依恋在照顾者与儿童的动态中得到了深入的探讨，但最近的研究表明，解释照顾者和婴儿之间依恋的原则也可以解释一个人一生中的依恋，特别是在亲密关系和浪漫纽带的背景下。[21]
Attachment bonds formed during early life lay the foundation for interpersonal relationships, interactions, personality characteristics, and mental health in the future.[22] Infants usually form attachments with their parents or immediate caregivers. Harlow's research on monkeys shows that infant monkeys form attachment bonds even with abusive mothers (in the experimental setup, the abusive 'mother' was a monkey made out of fabric who delivered mild shocks to the infant monkey or flung the infant monkey across the arena). 
早年形成的依恋纽带为未来的人际关系、互动、性格特征和心理健康奠定了基础。[22] 婴儿通常与父母或直接照顾者形成依恋。 哈洛对猴子的研究表明，即使与虐待的母亲，幼猴也会形成依恋纽带（在实验设置中，虐待的“母亲”是一只由织物制成的猴子，它对幼猴进行轻微的电击或将幼猴扔过竞技场）。These findings also apply to human attachment bonds. Even in situations where immediate caregivers are abusive, human infants still tend to attach to them; rejection from a caregiver only enhances the efforts to increase proximity to them and establish an attachment bond with them.[19]
Furthermore, in situations of danger, humans seek increased attachment. When ordinary pathways of attachment are unavailable, people tend to turn to their abusers. This leads to strong bonds and deep emotional connections with abusers. This attachment—both to abusive caregivers and to other abusers in the absence of a main caregiver—may be adaptive in the short run as it may aid survival. But in the long run, this attachment is maladaptive and can lay the foundation for, increase vulnerability to, and even directly lead to trauma bonding.

Stockholm syndrome[edit]
The concept of trauma bonding is often conflated with Stockholm syndrome. Although there are overarching similarities between the two, especially in the context of developing an emotional bond with one's abuser, trauma bonding and Stockholm syndrome are distinct from one another. The main difference is the direction of the relationship.[1]
In other words, in the case of Stockholm syndrome, the emotional connection is reciprocal, such that the abuser also appears to develop an emotional connection towards the abused and harbor positive feelings for the abused, in addition to the abused developing an emotional bond with the abuser.[1]

Realms of existence[edit]

In abusive relationships[edit]


Although the victim may disclose the abuse, the trauma bond means that the victim may wish to receive comfort from the very person who abused them.


PACE UK[23]
Unhealthy, or traumatic, bonding occurs between people in an abusive relationship. The bond is stronger for people who have grown up in abusive households and who believe abuse to be a normal part of relationships.[13] On the psychometric scale for Stockholm syndrome, the three main components are: justifying an abuser through cognitive distortions, damage, ongoing psychological effects of abuse, and love.[6]
Initially, the abuser is inconsistent in approach, increasing in intensity over time. As the bond progresses, it may become more difficult for victims to leave abusers with whom they have bonded.[13]
Fear, children, and financial constraints may be factors preventing victims from leaving abusive relationships.[24]

Battered women[edit]
Initial research about battered women held the view that a victim's return to an abusive relationship was an indicator of a flawed personality and, more specifically, masochism.[12] However, this view was perpetuated by the 'just-world fallacy', the cognitive bias towards the idea that people "get what is coming for them". The tendency to victim-blame arises from the belief that the world is a just and fair place where the victim is seen as deserving of any negative consequences. However, research on battered women and research on traumatic bonding have shown that that is not the case. In terms of battered women's decision to stay in or return to an abusive relationship, many factors are at play, ranging from family history and role expectations to access to resources to the dynamics of the relationship itself.[12] A crucial part of the relationship's dynamic is the existence of a trauma bond. Maltreatment interspersed with periods of kindness aids in the formation of a trauma bond that makes the victim harbor positive feelings towards the abuser.[12]
Among battered women, a three-phase process can explain the intermittent reward-punishment cycle. During phase one, there is a gradual increase in tension, followed by an "explosive battering incident" in phase two, which is then followed by a peaceful expression of love and affection from the abuser during phase three. These phases' recurring and cyclical nature gives rise to a trauma bond.[2]

Sex trafficking[edit]
Trauma bonds are extremely common in situations of sex trafficking, child grooming, commercial sexual exploitation of children (CSEC), and pimp-prostitute relationships.

Grooming[edit]
Child grooming involves establishing and maintaining trauma bonds between the child and the abuser. Along with the factors of power imbalance and intermittent reinforcement that contribute to trauma bonding, child grooming also necessitates gaining the trust of those around the child. Grooming also involves gaining the child's trust while simultaneously violating their boundaries. Treats and trips are used as bribes to both gain access to the child as well as ensure that they comply.[25] Intense attachments coupled with cognitive distortions deepen the bond.
A 2019 case study explores the life of one individual who was groomed. The victim's perception of the abuser as a benefactor, a substitute parent, and a mind controller all contributed to the development of a traumatic bond between the victim and the abuser.[25] In terms of being a benefactor, the abuser in this case study went above and beyond to give the victim what they needed. From getting the victim a job to gifting them a plot of land for their first house, the abuser was always present as a benefactor. The abuser also acted as a substitute parent, advising and offering emotional support in times of crisis. The roles of the abuser as a benefactor and substitute parent constituted the good treatment necessary to establish a trauma bond. In contrast, the abuser's role as a mind controller involved controlling and dominating tendencies that emulated being brainwashed.[25] This combination of perceptions established a traumatic bond that the victim found incredibly difficult to break because rejecting the emotional connection as a whole would also involve rejecting the perks and benefits—the trips, the gifts, the treats, the confidante, and the caretaker.
Child grooming can be understood from a developmental perspective as well, and the relationship between the victim and the abuser evolves across the lifespan. Grooming starts when the child is extremely young—the trust of the child and the family is acquired. The child is given immense attention and is showered with gifts.[25] As the individual matures and enters adolescence, the abuser becomes a confidante and a benefactor. In the case study mentioned previously, the abuser gave the victim career advice, picked him up, and dropped him off at school. Then, at the onset of adulthood, the abuser provided the victim with land to build their home and became the person the victim brought their partner home to. As the victim's developmental needs evolved, so did the abuser's response, such that the only thing constant was the victim's need for affection. In other words, the abuser was "able to capitalize on [the victim's] relational needs" until the victim was able to meet those needs in other ways.[25]

Commercial sexual exploitation of children (CSEC)[edit]
The commercial sexual exploitation of children (CSEC) can cause debilitating physical and psychological trauma. Along with causing functional impairments, it can amplify risk-taking behaviors and increase impulse dysregulation, further compromising the child's ability to conceptualize, comprehend, establish, and maintain boundaries. This can lead to confusion regarding what safety, affection, intimacy, and kindness entail, resulting in the formation of a trauma bond with the abuser or trafficker that is based on skewed perceptions of safety and kindness.[1] The trauma bond deepens and strengthens when isolation and threats to survival increase, forcing the victim to depend almost entirely on the abuser for survival and protection. This increased emotional dependence on the abuser normalizes the emotional violence experienced by the victim at the hands of the abuser, and gradually, the victim develops a sense of trust and safety, albeit skewed, towards the abuser.[1]

Trauma-coercive bond[edit]
Trauma bonding thrives in the presence of a power imbalance and intermittent reward/punishment behavior. Trauma-coercive bonding, on the other hand, has two additional elements: social isolation and the perceived inability to escape the situation. Since these two elements are crucial to the experiences of victims of CSEC, their bonds with their abusers are better described as trauma-coercive bonds rather than simply as trauma bonds. The element of coercion concreted by social isolation and the perceived inability to escape makes the trauma bond more complex and far more deeply rooted.[1] The use of coercive trauma bonding encapsulates the psycho-social dynamics of a relationship between a victim and a perpetrator of CSEC.

Intimate partner violence (IPV)[edit]
IPV has been defined as physical, sexual, psychological, economic, or stalking abuse, both concrete and menaced, perpetuated by current or ex-partners. Trauma bonding is used to solidify this type of relationship by rationalizing and/or minimizing a violent partner's behavior, self-blame, and reporting love in the context of fear.

Parent-child relationships[edit]
Trauma bonds in parent-child or caregiver-child dynamics can be borne from abuse, neglect, or incestuous relationships.[26]

Abuse and/or neglect[edit]
Children of dismissive caregivers or cruel caregivers can develop insecure attachments, which can be very dysfunctional. Inconsistencies in reward and punishment (i.e., intermittent reinforcement of good and bad treatment) can highlight the affection the child receives from the parent, forcing a split between the abuse and the kindness such that the child seeks to form an overall positive view of the caregiver and thus focuses only on the affection and kindness they receive.[15][8] Overall, a trauma bond develops such that the child's sense of self is derived from their emotional dependence on the authority figure, who, in this case, is the parent and/or caregiver.

Incest[edit]
Incestuous relationships between parents and children cultivate trauma bonds similar to those prevalent in victims of sex trafficking. All participants in a 1994 study by Jane Kay Hedberg on trauma in adult incest survivors demonstrated some trauma bonding with their abusers.[27] There was a positive correlation between the pervasiveness of the trauma bond and the amount of contact the victim or the victim's close family members had with the abuser: those who self-reported less pervasive trauma also reported sustained contact with their abuser, while those who self-reported more pervasive trauma demonstrated an active avoidance of maintaining a relationship with their abuser. In incestuous parent-child dynamics, the study found that maintaining an unhealthy relationship with the abuser contributes to trauma and sustains the trauma bond.[27] However, Hedberg cautions against generalizing findings from the study since the sample was small (n = 11) and wasn't representative of the general population of incest survivors.[footnote 1]
This aligns with the idea that trauma bonds are toxic and difficult to leave due to the inherent power imbalance, which, in parent-child relationships, is even more pervasive than in other situations. Incestuous relationships also have an added layer of betrayal trauma, which arises from the exploitation of the victim's trust, resulting in a feeling of betrayal.[22]

Military (tours of duty)[edit]
Trauma bonds can develop in military settings. The literature demonstrates this specifically in the context of tours of duty, wherein military personnel are deployed in hostile environments or areas of combat. A 2019 study exploring this specific phenomenon sought to understand the traumatic bond developed between Japanese soldiers and Korean 'comfort women' in the midst of World War II.[28] The trauma, in this case, was two-fold: not only did the trauma bond develop in an abused-abuser dynamic, but the trauma itself was also a result of and was perpetuated by the war. While the relationships provided the Japanese soldiers with emotional relief and an escape from the violence of the war and the tyranny of the higher-ranking officers, they also provided the Korean 'comfort women' with much-desired protection and kindness from the soldiers.[28]
Soldiers would behave aggressively and violently towards the 'comfort women' and often sexually exploit them. They would use intimidation tactics to assert dominance and foster coercion. However, this abuse would be interspersed with kindness and empathy from the soldiers, whose moods and subsequent behavior and interactions were highly contingent on the time and context of the ongoing war.[28] Nonetheless, the intermittent kindness allowed the formation and maintenance of a trauma bond. Intermittent rewards were sometimes also more tangible, in the form of food, outings, and physical protection. However, protection and emotional support were pivotal in maintaining the trauma bonds and far more important than food and outings. The Korean 'comfort women' eventually came to be emotionally dependent on the Japanese soldiers and began to relate this dependence with their own sense of power, thereby establishing a trauma bond that, for some, persisted even after the war was over.[28]

Outcomes[edit]
Trauma bonding has several short-term and long-term impacts on the abused. It can force people to stay in abusive relationships, negatively affect self-image and self-esteem, perpetuate transgenerational cycles of abuse, and result in adverse mental health outcomes like an increased likelihood of developing depression and/or bipolar disorder.[9][8][5][1]

Staying in abusive relationships[edit]
Owing to the debilitating psychological manipulation involved in the development of a trauma bond, abused people tend to stay in abusive relationships, mainly because the perceived consequences of leaving the relationship seem far more negative than the consequences of staying in the abusive relationship.[6][2]
In such relationships, maltreatment is often interspersed with fragments of solace and peace that involve the expression of love, kindness, affection, and/or general friendliness from the abuser towards the abused.[6] This intermittent reinforcement of a reward (here, the abuser's love and kindness) amidst all the abuse becomes what the victim begins to hold on to. Thus, victims tend to become emotionally dependent on the abuser and construct the belief that their survival is contingent upon receiving the abuser's love.[6] Victims thereby begin to formulate their sense of identity (a form of self) around receiving the abuser's affection, which points to what could be gaslighting. Kindness and affection from the abuser amidst the abuse become a focal point for the victim's emotional dependence. This dependency is characterized by the belief that their survival is contingent on the abuser's love and affection, leading victims to construct their sense of identity and self-worth around this dynamic.[29] Additionally, the provision of intermittent love and affection makes the victim cling to the hope that things can change.[11] Furthermore, self-blame, the fear of social stigma and embarrassment, the fear of loneliness in the absence of a partner, and the lack of or poor social support from other family and friends also contribute to individuals remaining in abusive relationships.[11]

Perpetuation of transgenerational cycles of abuse[edit]
People who have experienced trauma and traumatic bonds can, knowingly or unknowingly, repeat the cycle of abuse. In other words, victims who were traumatically bonded with abusers may grow to become abusers themselves. The abuse that victims inflict may or may not involve trauma bonding.[9]
For instance, in a 2018 study on convicted child murderers, researchers found that caregivers who committed child homicide (murdered their child or care receiver) had experienced traumatic experiences and had trauma bonds with abusers in their early lives.[8] Individuals with cruel and/or dismissive caregivers are likely to develop insecure attachments that result in a host of problems, including emotion deregulation and an attitude of confusion towards the caregiver, who becomes a source of comfort as well as fear. These adverse attachments can manifest in an individual's relationship with their own children as well. Attachment issues and painful memories of trauma bonds with their own caregivers can be triggered, and individuals may demonstrate heightened and disproportionate aggression toward their child, some culminating in homicide.[8] In this study, participants experienced physical abuse, sexual abuse, a lack of protection from external dangers, abandonment, emotional rejection, and more from their caregivers. Nonetheless, participants expressed unconditional love towards their caregivers, justified by wanting to maintain an overall positive view of them.[8] In their continued efforts to form an emotional connection, a trauma bond was fostered. These experiences had a severe negative impact on their relationship and bonding with their own children, contributing to "affectionless, unempathetic interpersonal behavior" that inflated aggressive and violent tendencies triggered by vulnerabilities.[8]

Neurophysiological outcomes[edit]
The experience of being in a trauma bond can have adverse neurological and neurophysiological outcomes. The body of the victim of a trauma bond is in a perpetual 'fight-or-flight' response state, which can increase cortisol levels that can have a cascading effect and trigger other hormones. 
Persistent, chronic stress can also hamper the cellular response in the body, thereby negatively impacting immunity, organ health, mood, energy levels, and more.[1] In the long run, this can cause epigenetic changes as well. Furthermore, a study conducted in 2015 found that establishing a trauma bond in infancy is also linked with amygdala dysfunction, neurobehavioral deficits, and increased vulnerability to psychiatric disorders later on in life.[30] Psychological abuse is correlated with sleep-related impairments. Disruption in sleep patterns leads to adverse neurophysiological problems, such as an increase in anxiety and irritability. For victims of psychological abuse, the increase in cortisol affects the brain in such a manner that it allows the trauma bonding to be strengthened.[31]

Adverse mental health outcomes[edit]
Trauma bonding is linked to several adverse mental health and well-being outcomes. Due to the abuse and the emotional dependence on their abusers, victims tend to develop an incredibly negative self-image. "Controlling, restricting, degrading, isolating, or dominating" abuse has a crippling effect on the self-image and self-esteem of the abused, and this psychological abuse is far more dangerous than physical abuse.[5] In a 2010 study on battered women labeling themselves as "stupid", researchers found that victims who felt like they allowed themselves to be mistreated and victims who stayed in abusive relationships labeled themselves as "stupid" for doing so.[10] This further contributes to a negative self-image and the maintenance of low self-esteem, both of which foster a poor self-concept, which, in turn, adversely impacts mental well-being. The same was observed in the case study mentioned previously on grooming.[25]
Trauma bonding can also lead to dissociative symptoms that could be a self-preservation and/or coping mechanism. Neurobiological changes can also affect brain development and hamper learning. The internalization of psychological manipulation and trauma can cause anxiety and increase the likelihood of engaging in risk-taking behaviors.[1] Furthermore, the isolation involved in trauma bonding can foster a generally skewed sense of trust, making victims vulnerable to situations that may retraumatize or revictimize them. Victims may also tend to either completely dismiss or minimize dangerous, damaging behaviors and violence around them.[1]
Trauma bonds in parent-child relationships (wherein the child is the victim and the parent is the abuser) can also lead to depressive symptoms later in life.[9] In a 2017 study exploring this, it was found that an "affectionless control" parenting style, characterized by high protection and low care from parents, was a major predictor of depressive symptomology for the victim. In other words, the presence of poor parental bonding coupled with childhood trauma bonds increased the likelihood of the child developing depressive symptoms in the future. A negative self-image is formed when feelings of inadequacy and hopelessness persist and are reinforced by caregivers. Perpetual efforts to seek secure emotional attachments reap no rewards, and a trauma bond facilitates a negative core schema that influences perceptions and interactions throughout one's life.[9] This can give rise to mental health issues such as depression, bipolar disorder, mania, suicidality, and substance abuse that can be pervasive and lifelong.

011. Two main factors facilitate forming and continuing a trauma bond: a power imbalance and intermittent reinforcement.[17][18]两个主要因素有助于形成和延续创伤纽带：权力不平衡和间歇性强化。[17] [18]

012. Power imbalance  功率不平衡

013. For a trauma bond to persist, a power differential must exist between the abuser and the victim such that the abuser is in a position of power and authority and the victim is not. Inequality in power can produce pathologies in individuals that can fortify the trauma bond. Upon experiencing intermittent punishment from the abuser or dominant individual, who is in a position of high power, the victim may internalize the abuser's perception of themselves.[2] This may result in a tendency for the victim to blame themselves in situations of violence perpetrated by the abuser, which can negatively impact the victim's self-concept.
为了使创伤纽带持续存在，施虐者和受害者之间必须存在权力差异，以便施虐者处于权力和权威的位置，而受害者则不然。权力不平等会在个人身上产生病态，从而加强创伤纽带。在经历施虐者或处于高位的支配者的间歇性惩罚后，受害者可能会内化施虐者对自己的看法。[2] 这可能会导致受害者在施虐者实施暴力的情况下倾向于责备自己，从而对受害者的自我概念产生负面影响。A negative self-appraisal can maximize the emotional dependency on the abuser and the cyclical nature of this dependency. Negative self-concept can eventually lead to the formation of a strong emotional bond from the victim to the abuser (i.e., to the person who is in a position of power and authority from the person who is not). Furthermore, physical, emotional, and sexual abuse can be used to maintain the power differential. This dynamic is also maintained via the interaction of the abuser's sense of power and the victim's sense of powerlessness and subjugation.[2]消极的自我评价可以最大限度地增加对施虐者的情感依赖以及这种依赖的周期性。消极的自我概念最终会导致受害者与施虐者（即与非施虐者之间处于权力和权威地位的人）之间形成强烈的情感纽带。此外，身体、情感和性虐待可以用来维持权力差异。这种动态也通过施虐者的权力感和受害者的无力感和征服感的相互作用来维持。[2]

Intermittent reinforcement间歇性加固[edit]
Intermittent reinforcement of rewards and punishments is crucial to establishing and maintaining a trauma bond. In trauma bonding, the abuser intermittently maltreats the victim through physical, verbal, emotional, and/or psychological abuse. This maltreatment is interspersed with positive behaviors like expressing affection and care, showing kindness, giving the victim gifts, and promising not to repeat the abuse. Alternating and sporadic periods of good and bad treatment serve to reinforce the victim intermittently.[2]间歇性强化奖励和惩罚对于建立和维持创伤纽带至关重要。在创伤联系中，施虐者通过身体、言语、情感和/或心理虐待间歇性地虐待受害者。这种虐待中穿插着积极的行为，例如表达爱意和关怀、表现出善意、给受害者礼物以及承诺不再重复虐待。交替和零星的好和坏待遇会间歇性地强化受害者。[2]
The pervasiveness of learning something through intermittent reinforcement can be elucidated by drawing from learning theory and the behaviorist perspective. In the presence of an aversive stimulus, reinforcement through rewards in unpredictable ways is a key component of learning. When the learner is unable to predict when they will get the reward, learning is maximized. Similarly, the intermittent expressions of affection and care are unexpected, and the inability to predict them makes them more sought after. Intermittent reinforcement produces behavioral patterns that are tough to terminate. Thus, they develop incredibly strong emotional bonds.[2]通过间歇性强化学习某事的普遍性可以通过学习理论和行为主义的观点来阐明。在存在厌恶刺激的情况下，通过以不可预测的方式奖励进行强化是学习的关键组成部分。当学习者无法预测他们何时会获得奖励时，学习就会最大化。同样，断断续续的爱意和关怀表达也是出乎意料的，无法预测也让它们更加受到追捧。间歇性强化会产生难以终止的行为模式。因此，他们建立了令人难以置信的强烈情感纽带。[2]

Maintenance  保养[edit]
A trauma bond can be maintained by keeping the power imbalance and the intermittency of abuse intact.
通过保持权力不平衡和虐待的间歇性完好无损，可以维持创伤纽带。Trauma bonds can also be maintained if the victim is financially dependent on the abuser or has some investment in the relationship, such as a child with the abuser.[6]如果受害者在经济上依赖施虐者或对这种关系有一些投资，例如与施虐者的孩子，也可以维持创伤纽带。[6]
Cognitive dissonance theory can also explain the maintenance of a trauma bond; it postulates that when individuals experience a conflict between their beliefs and actions, they are motivated to reduce or eliminate the incongruence to minimize the psychological discomfort. In this vein, victims may distort their cognition about the trauma and violence of the relationship to maintain a positive view of the relationship. This can involve rationalizing the abuser's behavior, justifications, minimizing the impact of the abuser's violence, and/or self-blaming.[6]认知失调理论也可以解释创伤纽带的维持;它假设，当个人经历他们的信念和行为之间的冲突时，他们有动力减少或消除不一致，以尽量减少心理不适。在这种精神下，受害者可能会扭曲他们对关系的创伤和暴力的认知，以保持对关系的积极看法。这可能涉及合理化施虐者的行为、理由、尽量减少施虐者暴力的影响和/或自责。[6]
Furthermore, research shows that the memory of instances wherein abuse was experienced is dissociated or state-dependent, meaning that the memories of abuse only fully resurface when the situation is similar in intensity and experience to the original situation of terror.[19]此外，研究表明，遭受虐待的记忆是分离的或依赖于状态的，这意味着只有当情况的强度和经历与最初的恐怖情况相似时，虐待的记忆才会完全重新出现。[19]
If and when the victim finally decides to leave the abusive relationship, the immediate relief from the traumatizing violence will begin to abate, and the underlying, deep attachment formed from intermittent reinforcement will begin to surface. This current period of vulnerability and emotional exhaustion will likely trigger memories of when the abuser was temporarily affectionate and caring. In the desire to receive that affection once more, the victim may try to return to the abusive relationship.[12][2]如果受害者最终决定离开虐待关系，那么从创伤性暴力中得到的直接缓解将开始减弱，而间歇性强化形成的潜在的、深层的依恋将开始浮出水面。当前的脆弱和情绪疲惫的时期可能会引发施虐者暂时深情和关怀的记忆。为了再次获得这种感情，受害者可能会试图回到虐待关系中。[12][2]
Strong social support, however, can be a protective factor in preserving the victim's functioning and providing a buffer in traumatic situations.[20]然而，强有力的社会支持可以成为保护受害者功能并在创伤情况下提供缓冲的保护因素。[20]

The role of attachment  依恋的作用[edit]
John Bowlby maintained that secure attachment was an evolutionary human need that superseded even the need for food and reproduction.[2] Attachment has been explored in depth in caregiver-child dynamics, but recent research has shown that the principles that explain attachment between caregivers and infants can also explain attachment throughout one's life span, specifically in the context of intimate relationships and romantic bonds.[21]约翰·鲍尔比坚持认为，安全依恋是人类进化的一种需求，甚至取代了对食物和繁殖的需求。[2] 依恋在照顾者与儿童的动态中得到了深入的探讨，但最近的研究表明，解释照顾者和婴儿之间依恋的原则也可以解释一个人一生中的依恋，特别是在亲密关系和浪漫纽带的背景下。[21]
Attachment bonds formed during early life lay the foundation for interpersonal relationships, interactions, personality characteristics, and mental health in the future.[22] Infants usually form attachments with their parents or immediate caregivers. Harlow's research on monkeys shows that infant monkeys form attachment bonds even with abusive mothers (in the experimental setup, the abusive 'mother' was a monkey made out of fabric who delivered mild shocks to the infant monkey or flung the infant monkey across the arena). 
早年形成的依恋纽带为未来的人际关系、互动、性格特征和心理健康奠定了基础。[22] 婴儿通常与父母或直接照顾者形成依恋。 哈洛对猴子的研究表明，即使与虐待的母亲，幼猴也会形成依恋纽带（在实验设置中，虐待的“母亲”是一只由织物制成的猴子，它对幼猴进行轻微的电击或将幼猴扔过竞技场）。These findings also apply to human attachment bonds. Even in situations where immediate caregivers are abusive, human infants still tend to attach to them; rejection from a caregiver only enhances the efforts to increase proximity to them and establish an attachment bond with them.[19]
Furthermore, in situations of danger, humans seek increased attachment. When ordinary pathways of attachment are unavailable, people tend to turn to their abusers. This leads to strong bonds and deep emotional connections with abusers. This attachment—both to abusive caregivers and to other abusers in the absence of a main caregiver—may be adaptive in the short run as it may aid survival. But in the long run, this attachment is maladaptive and can lay the foundation for, increase vulnerability to, and even directly lead to trauma bonding.

Stockholm syndrome[edit]
The concept of trauma bonding is often conflated with Stockholm syndrome. Although there are overarching similarities between the two, especially in the context of developing an emotional bond with one's abuser, trauma bonding and Stockholm syndrome are distinct from one another. The main difference is the direction of the relationship.[1]
In other words, in the case of Stockholm syndrome, the emotional connection is reciprocal, such that the abuser also appears to develop an emotional connection towards the abused and harbor positive feelings for the abused, in addition to the abused developing an emotional bond with the abuser.[1]

Realms of existence[edit]
This section needs expansion with: how a victim will try to preserve an abusive relationship (accusing innocent people, confabulating personal injury stories, etc.). You can help by adding to it. (December 2021)
In abusive relationships[edit]


Although the victim may disclose the abuse, the trauma bond means that the victim may wish to receive comfort from the very person who abused them.


PACE UK[23]
Unhealthy, or traumatic, bonding occurs between people in an abusive relationship. The bond is stronger for people who have grown up in abusive households and who believe abuse to be a normal part of relationships.[13] On the psychometric scale for Stockholm syndrome, the three main components are: justifying an abuser through cognitive distortions, damage, ongoing psychological effects of abuse, and love.[6]
Initially, the abuser is inconsistent in approach, increasing in intensity over time. As the bond progresses, it may become more difficult for victims to leave abusers with whom they have bonded.[13]
Fear, children, and financial constraints may be factors preventing victims from leaving abusive relationships.[24]

Battered women[edit]
Initial research about battered women held the view that a victim's return to an abusive relationship was an indicator of a flawed personality and, more specifically, masochism.[12] However, this view was perpetuated by the 'just-world fallacy', the cognitive bias towards the idea that people "get what is coming for them". The tendency to victim-blame arises from the belief that the world is a just and fair place where the victim is seen as deserving of any negative consequences. However, research on battered women and research on traumatic bonding have shown that that is not the case. In terms of battered women's decision to stay in or return to an abusive relationship, many factors are at play, ranging from family history and role expectations to access to resources to the dynamics of the relationship itself.[12] A crucial part of the relationship's dynamic is the existence of a trauma bond. Maltreatment interspersed with periods of kindness aids in the formation of a trauma bond that makes the victim harbor positive feelings towards the abuser.[12]
Among battered women, a three-phase process can explain the intermittent reward-punishment cycle. During phase one, there is a gradual increase in tension, followed by an "explosive battering incident" in phase two, which is then followed by a peaceful expression of love and affection from the abuser during phase three. These phases' recurring and cyclical nature gives rise to a trauma bond.[2]

Sex trafficking[edit]
Trauma bonds are extremely common in situations of sex trafficking, child grooming, commercial sexual exploitation of children (CSEC), and pimp-prostitute relationships.

Grooming[edit]
Child grooming involves establishing and maintaining trauma bonds between the child and the abuser. Along with the factors of power imbalance and intermittent reinforcement that contribute to trauma bonding, child grooming also necessitates gaining the trust of those around the child. Grooming also involves gaining the child's trust while simultaneously violating their boundaries. Treats and trips are used as bribes to both gain access to the child as well as ensure that they comply.[25] Intense attachments coupled with cognitive distortions deepen the bond.
A 2019 case study explores the life of one individual who was groomed. The victim's perception of the abuser as a benefactor, a substitute parent, and a mind controller all contributed to the development of a traumatic bond between the victim and the abuser.[25] In terms of being a benefactor, the abuser in this case study went above and beyond to give the victim what they needed. From getting the victim a job to gifting them a plot of land for their first house, the abuser was always present as a benefactor. The abuser also acted as a substitute parent, advising and offering emotional support in times of crisis. The roles of the abuser as a benefactor and substitute parent constituted the good treatment necessary to establish a trauma bond. In contrast, the abuser's role as a mind controller involved controlling and dominating tendencies that emulated being brainwashed.[25] This combination of perceptions established a traumatic bond that the victim found incredibly difficult to break because rejecting the emotional connection as a whole would also involve rejecting the perks and benefits—the trips, the gifts, the treats, the confidante, and the caretaker.
Child grooming can be understood from a developmental perspective as well, and the relationship between the victim and the abuser evolves across the lifespan. Grooming starts when the child is extremely young—the trust of the child and the family is acquired. The child is given immense attention and is showered with gifts.[25] As the individual matures and enters adolescence, the abuser becomes a confidante and a benefactor. In the case study mentioned previously, the abuser gave the victim career advice, picked him up, and dropped him off at school. Then, at the onset of adulthood, the abuser provided the victim with land to build their home and became the person the victim brought their partner home to. As the victim's developmental needs evolved, so did the abuser's response, such that the only thing constant was the victim's need for affection. In other words, the abuser was "able to capitalize on [the victim's] relational needs" until the victim was able to meet those needs in other ways.[25]

Commercial sexual exploitation of children (CSEC)[edit]
The commercial sexual exploitation of children (CSEC) can cause debilitating physical and psychological trauma. Along with causing functional impairments, it can amplify risk-taking behaviors and increase impulse dysregulation, further compromising the child's ability to conceptualize, comprehend, establish, and maintain boundaries. This can lead to confusion regarding what safety, affection, intimacy, and kindness entail, resulting in the formation of a trauma bond with the abuser or trafficker that is based on skewed perceptions of safety and kindness.[1] The trauma bond deepens and strengthens when isolation and threats to survival increase, forcing the victim to depend almost entirely on the abuser for survival and protection. This increased emotional dependence on the abuser normalizes the emotional violence experienced by the victim at the hands of the abuser, and gradually, the victim develops a sense of trust and safety, albeit skewed, towards the abuser.[1]

Trauma-coercive bond[edit]
Trauma bonding thrives in the presence of a power imbalance and intermittent reward/punishment behavior. Trauma-coercive bonding, on the other hand, has two additional elements: social isolation and the perceived inability to escape the situation. Since these two elements are crucial to the experiences of victims of CSEC, their bonds with their abusers are better described as trauma-coercive bonds rather than simply as trauma bonds. The element of coercion concreted by social isolation and the perceived inability to escape makes the trauma bond more complex and far more deeply rooted.[1] The use of coercive trauma bonding encapsulates the psycho-social dynamics of a relationship between a victim and a perpetrator of CSEC.

Intimate partner violence (IPV)[edit]
IPV has been defined as physical, sexual, psychological, economic, or stalking abuse, both concrete and menaced, perpetuated by current or ex-partners. Trauma bonding is used to solidify this type of relationship by rationalizing and/or minimizing a violent partner's behavior, self-blame, and reporting love in the context of fear.

Parent-child relationships[edit]
Trauma bonds in parent-child or caregiver-child dynamics can be borne from abuse, neglect, or incestuous relationships.[26]

Abuse and/or neglect[edit]
Children of dismissive caregivers or cruel caregivers can develop insecure attachments, which can be very dysfunctional. Inconsistencies in reward and punishment (i.e., intermittent reinforcement of good and bad treatment) can highlight the affection the child receives from the parent, forcing a split between the abuse and the kindness such that the child seeks to form an overall positive view of the caregiver and thus focuses only on the affection and kindness they receive.[15][8] Overall, a trauma bond develops such that the child's sense of self is derived from their emotional dependence on the authority figure, who, in this case, is the parent and/or caregiver.

Incest[edit]
Incestuous relationships between parents and children cultivate trauma bonds similar to those prevalent in victims of sex trafficking. All participants in a 1994 study by Jane Kay Hedberg on trauma in adult incest survivors demonstrated some trauma bonding with their abusers.[27] There was a positive correlation between the pervasiveness of the trauma bond and the amount of contact the victim or the victim's close family members had with the abuser: those who self-reported less pervasive trauma also reported sustained contact with their abuser, while those who self-reported more pervasive trauma demonstrated an active avoidance of maintaining a relationship with their abuser. In incestuous parent-child dynamics, the study found that maintaining an unhealthy relationship with the abuser contributes to trauma and sustains the trauma bond.[27] However, Hedberg cautions against generalizing findings from the study since the sample was small (n = 11) and wasn't representative of the general population of incest survivors.[footnote 1]
This aligns with the idea that trauma bonds are toxic and difficult to leave due to the inherent power imbalance, which, in parent-child relationships, is even more pervasive than in other situations. Incestuous relationships also have an added layer of betrayal trauma, which arises from the exploitation of the victim's trust, resulting in a feeling of betrayal.[22]

Military (tours of duty)[edit]
Trauma bonds can develop in military settings. The literature demonstrates this specifically in the context of tours of duty, wherein military personnel are deployed in hostile environments or areas of combat. A 2019 study exploring this specific phenomenon sought to understand the traumatic bond developed between Japanese soldiers and Korean 'comfort women' in the midst of World War II.[28] The trauma, in this case, was two-fold: not only did the trauma bond develop in an abused-abuser dynamic, but the trauma itself was also a result of and was perpetuated by the war. While the relationships provided the Japanese soldiers with emotional relief and an escape from the violence of the war and the tyranny of the higher-ranking officers, they also provided the Korean 'comfort women' with much-desired protection and kindness from the soldiers.[28]
Soldiers would behave aggressively and violently towards the 'comfort women' and often sexually exploit them. They would use intimidation tactics to assert dominance and foster coercion. However, this abuse would be interspersed with kindness and empathy from the soldiers, whose moods and subsequent behavior and interactions were highly contingent on the time and context of the ongoing war.[28] Nonetheless, the intermittent kindness allowed the formation and maintenance of a trauma bond. Intermittent rewards were sometimes also more tangible, in the form of food, outings, and physical protection. However, protection and emotional support were pivotal in maintaining the trauma bonds and far more important than food and outings. The Korean 'comfort women' eventually came to be emotionally dependent on the Japanese soldiers and began to relate this dependence with their own sense of power, thereby establishing a trauma bond that, for some, persisted even after the war was over.[28]

Outcomes[edit]
Trauma bonding has several short-term and long-term impacts on the abused. It can force people to stay in abusive relationships, negatively affect self-image and self-esteem, perpetuate transgenerational cycles of abuse, and result in adverse mental health outcomes like an increased likelihood of developing depression and/or bipolar disorder.[9][8][5][1]

Staying in abusive relationships[edit]
Owing to the debilitating psychological manipulation involved in the development of a trauma bond, abused people tend to stay in abusive relationships, mainly because the perceived consequences of leaving the relationship seem far more negative than the consequences of staying in the abusive relationship.[6][2]
In such relationships, maltreatment is often interspersed with fragments of solace and peace that involve the expression of love, kindness, affection, and/or general friendliness from the abuser towards the abused.[6] This intermittent reinforcement of a reward (here, the abuser's love and kindness) amidst all the abuse becomes what the victim begins to hold on to. Thus, victims tend to become emotionally dependent on the abuser and construct the belief that their survival is contingent upon receiving the abuser's love.[6] Victims thereby begin to formulate their sense of identity (a form of self) around receiving the abuser's affection, which points to what could be gaslighting. Kindness and affection from the abuser amidst the abuse become a focal point for the victim's emotional dependence. This dependency is characterized by the belief that their survival is contingent on the abuser's love and affection, leading victims to construct their sense of identity and self-worth around this dynamic.[29] Additionally, the provision of intermittent love and affection makes the victim cling to the hope that things can change.[11] Furthermore, self-blame, the fear of social stigma and embarrassment, the fear of loneliness in the absence of a partner, and the lack of or poor social support from other family and friends also contribute to individuals remaining in abusive relationships.[11]

Perpetuation of transgenerational cycles of abuse[edit]
People who have experienced trauma and traumatic bonds can, knowingly or unknowingly, repeat the cycle of abuse. In other words, victims who were traumatically bonded with abusers may grow to become abusers themselves. The abuse that victims inflict may or may not involve trauma bonding.[9]
For instance, in a 2018 study on convicted child murderers, researchers found that caregivers who committed child homicide (murdered their child or care receiver) had experienced traumatic experiences and had trauma bonds with abusers in their early lives.[8] Individuals with cruel and/or dismissive caregivers are likely to develop insecure attachments that result in a host of problems, including emotion deregulation and an attitude of confusion towards the caregiver, who becomes a source of comfort as well as fear. These adverse attachments can manifest in an individual's relationship with their own children as well. Attachment issues and painful memories of trauma bonds with their own caregivers can be triggered, and individuals may demonstrate heightened and disproportionate aggression toward their child, some culminating in homicide.[8] In this study, participants experienced physical abuse, sexual abuse, a lack of protection from external dangers, abandonment, emotional rejection, and more from their caregivers. Nonetheless, participants expressed unconditional love towards their caregivers, justified by wanting to maintain an overall positive view of them.[8] In their continued efforts to form an emotional connection, a trauma bond was fostered. These experiences had a severe negative impact on their relationship and bonding with their own children, contributing to "affectionless, unempathetic interpersonal behavior" that inflated aggressive and violent tendencies triggered by vulnerabilities.[8]

Neurophysiological outcomes[edit]
The experience of being in a trauma bond can have adverse neurological and neurophysiological outcomes. The body of the victim of a trauma bond is in a perpetual 'fight-or-flight' response state, which can increase cortisol levels that can have a cascading effect and trigger other hormones. 
Persistent, chronic stress can also hamper the cellular response in the body, thereby negatively impacting immunity, organ health, mood, energy levels, and more.[1] In the long run, this can cause epigenetic changes as well. Furthermore, a study conducted in 2015 found that establishing a trauma bond in infancy is also linked with amygdala dysfunction, neurobehavioral deficits, and increased vulnerability to psychiatric disorders later on in life.[30] Psychological abuse is correlated with sleep-related impairments. Disruption in sleep patterns leads to adverse neurophysiological problems, such as an increase in anxiety and irritability. For victims of psychological abuse, the increase in cortisol affects the brain in such a manner that it allows the trauma bonding to be strengthened.[31]

Adverse mental health outcomes[edit]
Trauma bonding is linked to several adverse mental health and well-being outcomes. Due to the abuse and the emotional dependence on their abusers, victims tend to develop an incredibly negative self-image. "Controlling, restricting, degrading, isolating, or dominating" abuse has a crippling effect on the self-image and self-esteem of the abused, and this psychological abuse is far more dangerous than physical abuse.[5] In a 2010 study on battered women labeling themselves as "stupid", researchers found that victims who felt like they allowed themselves to be mistreated and victims who stayed in abusive relationships labeled themselves as "stupid" for doing so.[10] This further contributes to a negative self-image and the maintenance of low self-esteem, both of which foster a poor self-concept, which, in turn, adversely impacts mental well-being. The same was observed in the case study mentioned previously on grooming.[25]
Trauma bonding can also lead to dissociative symptoms that could be a self-preservation and/or coping mechanism. Neurobiological changes can also affect brain development and hamper learning. The internalization of psychological manipulation and trauma can cause anxiety and increase the likelihood of engaging in risk-taking behaviors.[1] Furthermore, the isolation involved in trauma bonding can foster a generally skewed sense of trust, making victims vulnerable to situations that may retraumatize or revictimize them. Victims may also tend to either completely dismiss or minimize dangerous, damaging behaviors and violence around them.[1]
Trauma bonds in parent-child relationships (wherein the child is the victim and the parent is the abuser) can also lead to depressive symptoms later in life.[9] In a 2017 study exploring this, it was found that an "affectionless control" parenting style, characterized by high protection and low care from parents, was a major predictor of depressive symptomology for the victim. In other words, the presence of poor parental bonding coupled with childhood trauma bonds increased the likelihood of the child developing depressive symptoms in the future. A negative self-image is formed when feelings of inadequacy and hopelessness persist and are reinforced by caregivers. Perpetual efforts to seek secure emotional attachments reap no rewards, and a trauma bond facilitates a negative core schema that influences perceptions and interactions throughout one's life.[9] This can give rise to mental health issues such as depression, bipolar disorder, mania, suicidality, and substance abuse that can be pervasive and lifelong.

014. A negative self-appraisal can maximize the emotional dependency on the abuser and the cyclical nature of this dependency. Negative self-concept can eventually lead to the formation of a strong emotional bond from the victim to the abuser (i.e., to the person who is in a position of power and authority from the person who is not). Furthermore, physical, emotional, and sexual abuse can be used to maintain the power differential. This dynamic is also maintained via the interaction of the abuser's sense of power and the victim's sense of powerlessness and subjugation.[2]消极的自我评价可以最大限度地增加对施虐者的情感依赖以及这种依赖的周期性。消极的自我概念最终会导致受害者与施虐者（即与非施虐者之间处于权力和权威地位的人）之间形成强烈的情感纽带。此外，身体、情感和性虐待可以用来维持权力差异。这种动态也通过施虐者的权力感和受害者的无力感和征服感的相互作用来维持。[2]

015. Intermittent reinforcement间歇性加固

016. Intermittent reinforcement of rewards and punishments is crucial to establishing and maintaining a trauma bond. In trauma bonding, the abuser intermittently maltreats the victim through physical, verbal, emotional, and/or psychological abuse. This maltreatment is interspersed with positive behaviors like expressing affection and care, showing kindness, giving the victim gifts, and promising not to repeat the abuse. Alternating and sporadic periods of good and bad treatment serve to reinforce the victim intermittently.[2]间歇性强化奖励和惩罚对于建立和维持创伤纽带至关重要。在创伤联系中，施虐者通过身体、言语、情感和/或心理虐待间歇性地虐待受害者。这种虐待中穿插着积极的行为，例如表达爱意和关怀、表现出善意、给受害者礼物以及承诺不再重复虐待。交替和零星的好和坏待遇会间歇性地强化受害者。[2]
The pervasiveness of learning something through intermittent reinforcement can be elucidated by drawing from learning theory and the behaviorist perspective. In the presence of an aversive stimulus, reinforcement through rewards in unpredictable ways is a key component of learning. When the learner is unable to predict when they will get the reward, learning is maximized. Similarly, the intermittent expressions of affection and care are unexpected, and the inability to predict them makes them more sought after. Intermittent reinforcement produces behavioral patterns that are tough to terminate. Thus, they develop incredibly strong emotional bonds.[2]通过间歇性强化学习某事的普遍性可以通过学习理论和行为主义的观点来阐明。在存在厌恶刺激的情况下，通过以不可预测的方式奖励进行强化是学习的关键组成部分。当学习者无法预测他们何时会获得奖励时，学习就会最大化。同样，断断续续的爱意和关怀表达也是出乎意料的，无法预测也让它们更加受到追捧。间歇性强化会产生难以终止的行为模式。因此，他们建立了令人难以置信的强烈情感纽带。[2]

Maintenance  保养[edit]
A trauma bond can be maintained by keeping the power imbalance and the intermittency of abuse intact.
通过保持权力不平衡和虐待的间歇性完好无损，可以维持创伤纽带。Trauma bonds can also be maintained if the victim is financially dependent on the abuser or has some investment in the relationship, such as a child with the abuser.[6]如果受害者在经济上依赖施虐者或对这种关系有一些投资，例如与施虐者的孩子，也可以维持创伤纽带。[6]
Cognitive dissonance theory can also explain the maintenance of a trauma bond; it postulates that when individuals experience a conflict between their beliefs and actions, they are motivated to reduce or eliminate the incongruence to minimize the psychological discomfort. In this vein, victims may distort their cognition about the trauma and violence of the relationship to maintain a positive view of the relationship. This can involve rationalizing the abuser's behavior, justifications, minimizing the impact of the abuser's violence, and/or self-blaming.[6]认知失调理论也可以解释创伤纽带的维持;它假设，当个人经历他们的信念和行为之间的冲突时，他们有动力减少或消除不一致，以尽量减少心理不适。在这种精神下，受害者可能会扭曲他们对关系的创伤和暴力的认知，以保持对关系的积极看法。这可能涉及合理化施虐者的行为、理由、尽量减少施虐者暴力的影响和/或自责。[6]
Furthermore, research shows that the memory of instances wherein abuse was experienced is dissociated or state-dependent, meaning that the memories of abuse only fully resurface when the situation is similar in intensity and experience to the original situation of terror.[19]此外，研究表明，遭受虐待的记忆是分离的或依赖于状态的，这意味着只有当情况的强度和经历与最初的恐怖情况相似时，虐待的记忆才会完全重新出现。[19]
If and when the victim finally decides to leave the abusive relationship, the immediate relief from the traumatizing violence will begin to abate, and the underlying, deep attachment formed from intermittent reinforcement will begin to surface. This current period of vulnerability and emotional exhaustion will likely trigger memories of when the abuser was temporarily affectionate and caring. In the desire to receive that affection once more, the victim may try to return to the abusive relationship.[12][2]如果受害者最终决定离开虐待关系，那么从创伤性暴力中得到的直接缓解将开始减弱，而间歇性强化形成的潜在的、深层的依恋将开始浮出水面。当前的脆弱和情绪疲惫的时期可能会引发施虐者暂时深情和关怀的记忆。为了再次获得这种感情，受害者可能会试图回到虐待关系中。[12][2]
Strong social support, however, can be a protective factor in preserving the victim's functioning and providing a buffer in traumatic situations.[20]然而，强有力的社会支持可以成为保护受害者功能并在创伤情况下提供缓冲的保护因素。[20]

The role of attachment  依恋的作用[edit]
John Bowlby maintained that secure attachment was an evolutionary human need that superseded even the need for food and reproduction.[2] Attachment has been explored in depth in caregiver-child dynamics, but recent research has shown that the principles that explain attachment between caregivers and infants can also explain attachment throughout one's life span, specifically in the context of intimate relationships and romantic bonds.[21]约翰·鲍尔比坚持认为，安全依恋是人类进化的一种需求，甚至取代了对食物和繁殖的需求。[2] 依恋在照顾者与儿童的动态中得到了深入的探讨，但最近的研究表明，解释照顾者和婴儿之间依恋的原则也可以解释一个人一生中的依恋，特别是在亲密关系和浪漫纽带的背景下。[21]
Attachment bonds formed during early life lay the foundation for interpersonal relationships, interactions, personality characteristics, and mental health in the future.[22] Infants usually form attachments with their parents or immediate caregivers. Harlow's research on monkeys shows that infant monkeys form attachment bonds even with abusive mothers (in the experimental setup, the abusive 'mother' was a monkey made out of fabric who delivered mild shocks to the infant monkey or flung the infant monkey across the arena). 
早年形成的依恋纽带为未来的人际关系、互动、性格特征和心理健康奠定了基础。[22] 婴儿通常与父母或直接照顾者形成依恋。 哈洛对猴子的研究表明，即使与虐待的母亲，幼猴也会形成依恋纽带（在实验设置中，虐待的“母亲”是一只由织物制成的猴子，它对幼猴进行轻微的电击或将幼猴扔过竞技场）。These findings also apply to human attachment bonds. Even in situations where immediate caregivers are abusive, human infants still tend to attach to them; rejection from a caregiver only enhances the efforts to increase proximity to them and establish an attachment bond with them.[19]
Furthermore, in situations of danger, humans seek increased attachment. When ordinary pathways of attachment are unavailable, people tend to turn to their abusers. This leads to strong bonds and deep emotional connections with abusers. This attachment—both to abusive caregivers and to other abusers in the absence of a main caregiver—may be adaptive in the short run as it may aid survival. But in the long run, this attachment is maladaptive and can lay the foundation for, increase vulnerability to, and even directly lead to trauma bonding.

Stockholm syndrome[edit]
The concept of trauma bonding is often conflated with Stockholm syndrome. Although there are overarching similarities between the two, especially in the context of developing an emotional bond with one's abuser, trauma bonding and Stockholm syndrome are distinct from one another. The main difference is the direction of the relationship.[1]
In other words, in the case of Stockholm syndrome, the emotional connection is reciprocal, such that the abuser also appears to develop an emotional connection towards the abused and harbor positive feelings for the abused, in addition to the abused developing an emotional bond with the abuser.[1]

Realms of existence[edit]

In abusive relationships[edit]


Although the victim may disclose the abuse, the trauma bond means that the victim may wish to receive comfort from the very person who abused them.


PACE UK[23]
Unhealthy, or traumatic, bonding occurs between people in an abusive relationship. The bond is stronger for people who have grown up in abusive households and who believe abuse to be a normal part of relationships.[13] On the psychometric scale for Stockholm syndrome, the three main components are: justifying an abuser through cognitive distortions, damage, ongoing psychological effects of abuse, and love.[6]
Initially, the abuser is inconsistent in approach, increasing in intensity over time. As the bond progresses, it may become more difficult for victims to leave abusers with whom they have bonded.[13]
Fear, children, and financial constraints may be factors preventing victims from leaving abusive relationships.[24]

Battered women[edit]
Initial research about battered women held the view that a victim's return to an abusive relationship was an indicator of a flawed personality and, more specifically, masochism.[12] However, this view was perpetuated by the 'just-world fallacy', the cognitive bias towards the idea that people "get what is coming for them". The tendency to victim-blame arises from the belief that the world is a just and fair place where the victim is seen as deserving of any negative consequences. However, research on battered women and research on traumatic bonding have shown that that is not the case. In terms of battered women's decision to stay in or return to an abusive relationship, many factors are at play, ranging from family history and role expectations to access to resources to the dynamics of the relationship itself.[12] A crucial part of the relationship's dynamic is the existence of a trauma bond. Maltreatment interspersed with periods of kindness aids in the formation of a trauma bond that makes the victim harbor positive feelings towards the abuser.[12]
Among battered women, a three-phase process can explain the intermittent reward-punishment cycle. During phase one, there is a gradual increase in tension, followed by an "explosive battering incident" in phase two, which is then followed by a peaceful expression of love and affection from the abuser during phase three. These phases' recurring and cyclical nature gives rise to a trauma bond.[2]

Sex trafficking[edit]
Trauma bonds are extremely common in situations of sex trafficking, child grooming, commercial sexual exploitation of children (CSEC), and pimp-prostitute relationships.

Grooming[edit]
Child grooming involves establishing and maintaining trauma bonds between the child and the abuser. Along with the factors of power imbalance and intermittent reinforcement that contribute to trauma bonding, child grooming also necessitates gaining the trust of those around the child. Grooming also involves gaining the child's trust while simultaneously violating their boundaries. Treats and trips are used as bribes to both gain access to the child as well as ensure that they comply.[25] Intense attachments coupled with cognitive distortions deepen the bond.
A 2019 case study explores the life of one individual who was groomed. The victim's perception of the abuser as a benefactor, a substitute parent, and a mind controller all contributed to the development of a traumatic bond between the victim and the abuser.[25] In terms of being a benefactor, the abuser in this case study went above and beyond to give the victim what they needed. From getting the victim a job to gifting them a plot of land for their first house, the abuser was always present as a benefactor. The abuser also acted as a substitute parent, advising and offering emotional support in times of crisis. The roles of the abuser as a benefactor and substitute parent constituted the good treatment necessary to establish a trauma bond. In contrast, the abuser's role as a mind controller involved controlling and dominating tendencies that emulated being brainwashed.[25] This combination of perceptions established a traumatic bond that the victim found incredibly difficult to break because rejecting the emotional connection as a whole would also involve rejecting the perks and benefits—the trips, the gifts, the treats, the confidante, and the caretaker.
Child grooming can be understood from a developmental perspective as well, and the relationship between the victim and the abuser evolves across the lifespan. Grooming starts when the child is extremely young—the trust of the child and the family is acquired. The child is given immense attention and is showered with gifts.[25] As the individual matures and enters adolescence, the abuser becomes a confidante and a benefactor. In the case study mentioned previously, the abuser gave the victim career advice, picked him up, and dropped him off at school. Then, at the onset of adulthood, the abuser provided the victim with land to build their home and became the person the victim brought their partner home to. As the victim's developmental needs evolved, so did the abuser's response, such that the only thing constant was the victim's need for affection. In other words, the abuser was "able to capitalize on [the victim's] relational needs" until the victim was able to meet those needs in other ways.[25]

Commercial sexual exploitation of children (CSEC)[edit]
The commercial sexual exploitation of children (CSEC) can cause debilitating physical and psychological trauma. Along with causing functional impairments, it can amplify risk-taking behaviors and increase impulse dysregulation, further compromising the child's ability to conceptualize, comprehend, establish, and maintain boundaries. This can lead to confusion regarding what safety, affection, intimacy, and kindness entail, resulting in the formation of a trauma bond with the abuser or trafficker that is based on skewed perceptions of safety and kindness.[1] The trauma bond deepens and strengthens when isolation and threats to survival increase, forcing the victim to depend almost entirely on the abuser for survival and protection. This increased emotional dependence on the abuser normalizes the emotional violence experienced by the victim at the hands of the abuser, and gradually, the victim develops a sense of trust and safety, albeit skewed, towards the abuser.[1]

Trauma-coercive bond[edit]
Trauma bonding thrives in the presence of a power imbalance and intermittent reward/punishment behavior. Trauma-coercive bonding, on the other hand, has two additional elements: social isolation and the perceived inability to escape the situation. Since these two elements are crucial to the experiences of victims of CSEC, their bonds with their abusers are better described as trauma-coercive bonds rather than simply as trauma bonds. The element of coercion concreted by social isolation and the perceived inability to escape makes the trauma bond more complex and far more deeply rooted.[1] The use of coercive trauma bonding encapsulates the psycho-social dynamics of a relationship between a victim and a perpetrator of CSEC.

Intimate partner violence (IPV)[edit]
IPV has been defined as physical, sexual, psychological, economic, or stalking abuse, both concrete and menaced, perpetuated by current or ex-partners. Trauma bonding is used to solidify this type of relationship by rationalizing and/or minimizing a violent partner's behavior, self-blame, and reporting love in the context of fear.

Parent-child relationships[edit]
Trauma bonds in parent-child or caregiver-child dynamics can be borne from abuse, neglect, or incestuous relationships.[26]

Abuse and/or neglect[edit]
Children of dismissive caregivers or cruel caregivers can develop insecure attachments, which can be very dysfunctional. Inconsistencies in reward and punishment (i.e., intermittent reinforcement of good and bad treatment) can highlight the affection the child receives from the parent, forcing a split between the abuse and the kindness such that the child seeks to form an overall positive view of the caregiver and thus focuses only on the affection and kindness they receive.[15][8] Overall, a trauma bond develops such that the child's sense of self is derived from their emotional dependence on the authority figure, who, in this case, is the parent and/or caregiver.

Incest[edit]
Incestuous relationships between parents and children cultivate trauma bonds similar to those prevalent in victims of sex trafficking. All participants in a 1994 study by Jane Kay Hedberg on trauma in adult incest survivors demonstrated some trauma bonding with their abusers.[27] There was a positive correlation between the pervasiveness of the trauma bond and the amount of contact the victim or the victim's close family members had with the abuser: those who self-reported less pervasive trauma also reported sustained contact with their abuser, while those who self-reported more pervasive trauma demonstrated an active avoidance of maintaining a relationship with their abuser. In incestuous parent-child dynamics, the study found that maintaining an unhealthy relationship with the abuser contributes to trauma and sustains the trauma bond.[27] However, Hedberg cautions against generalizing findings from the study since the sample was small (n = 11) and wasn't representative of the general population of incest survivors.[footnote 1]
This aligns with the idea that trauma bonds are toxic and difficult to leave due to the inherent power imbalance, which, in parent-child relationships, is even more pervasive than in other situations. Incestuous relationships also have an added layer of betrayal trauma, which arises from the exploitation of the victim's trust, resulting in a feeling of betrayal.[22]

Military (tours of duty)[edit]
Trauma bonds can develop in military settings. The literature demonstrates this specifically in the context of tours of duty, wherein military personnel are deployed in hostile environments or areas of combat. A 2019 study exploring this specific phenomenon sought to understand the traumatic bond developed between Japanese soldiers and Korean 'comfort women' in the midst of World War II.[28] The trauma, in this case, was two-fold: not only did the trauma bond develop in an abused-abuser dynamic, but the trauma itself was also a result of and was perpetuated by the war. While the relationships provided the Japanese soldiers with emotional relief and an escape from the violence of the war and the tyranny of the higher-ranking officers, they also provided the Korean 'comfort women' with much-desired protection and kindness from the soldiers.[28]
Soldiers would behave aggressively and violently towards the 'comfort women' and often sexually exploit them. They would use intimidation tactics to assert dominance and foster coercion. However, this abuse would be interspersed with kindness and empathy from the soldiers, whose moods and subsequent behavior and interactions were highly contingent on the time and context of the ongoing war.[28] Nonetheless, the intermittent kindness allowed the formation and maintenance of a trauma bond. Intermittent rewards were sometimes also more tangible, in the form of food, outings, and physical protection. However, protection and emotional support were pivotal in maintaining the trauma bonds and far more important than food and outings. The Korean 'comfort women' eventually came to be emotionally dependent on the Japanese soldiers and began to relate this dependence with their own sense of power, thereby establishing a trauma bond that, for some, persisted even after the war was over.[28]

Outcomes[edit]
Trauma bonding has several short-term and long-term impacts on the abused. It can force people to stay in abusive relationships, negatively affect self-image and self-esteem, perpetuate transgenerational cycles of abuse, and result in adverse mental health outcomes like an increased likelihood of developing depression and/or bipolar disorder.[9][8][5][1]

Staying in abusive relationships[edit]
Owing to the debilitating psychological manipulation involved in the development of a trauma bond, abused people tend to stay in abusive relationships, mainly because the perceived consequences of leaving the relationship seem far more negative than the consequences of staying in the abusive relationship.[6][2]
In such relationships, maltreatment is often interspersed with fragments of solace and peace that involve the expression of love, kindness, affection, and/or general friendliness from the abuser towards the abused.[6] This intermittent reinforcement of a reward (here, the abuser's love and kindness) amidst all the abuse becomes what the victim begins to hold on to. Thus, victims tend to become emotionally dependent on the abuser and construct the belief that their survival is contingent upon receiving the abuser's love.[6] Victims thereby begin to formulate their sense of identity (a form of self) around receiving the abuser's affection, which points to what could be gaslighting. Kindness and affection from the abuser amidst the abuse become a focal point for the victim's emotional dependence. This dependency is characterized by the belief that their survival is contingent on the abuser's love and affection, leading victims to construct their sense of identity and self-worth around this dynamic.[29] Additionally, the provision of intermittent love and affection makes the victim cling to the hope that things can change.[11] Furthermore, self-blame, the fear of social stigma and embarrassment, the fear of loneliness in the absence of a partner, and the lack of or poor social support from other family and friends also contribute to individuals remaining in abusive relationships.[11]

Perpetuation of transgenerational cycles of abuse[edit]
People who have experienced trauma and traumatic bonds can, knowingly or unknowingly, repeat the cycle of abuse. In other words, victims who were traumatically bonded with abusers may grow to become abusers themselves. The abuse that victims inflict may or may not involve trauma bonding.[9]
For instance, in a 2018 study on convicted child murderers, researchers found that caregivers who committed child homicide (murdered their child or care receiver) had experienced traumatic experiences and had trauma bonds with abusers in their early lives.[8] Individuals with cruel and/or dismissive caregivers are likely to develop insecure attachments that result in a host of problems, including emotion deregulation and an attitude of confusion towards the caregiver, who becomes a source of comfort as well as fear. These adverse attachments can manifest in an individual's relationship with their own children as well. Attachment issues and painful memories of trauma bonds with their own caregivers can be triggered, and individuals may demonstrate heightened and disproportionate aggression toward their child, some culminating in homicide.[8] In this study, participants experienced physical abuse, sexual abuse, a lack of protection from external dangers, abandonment, emotional rejection, and more from their caregivers. Nonetheless, participants expressed unconditional love towards their caregivers, justified by wanting to maintain an overall positive view of them.[8] In their continued efforts to form an emotional connection, a trauma bond was fostered. These experiences had a severe negative impact on their relationship and bonding with their own children, contributing to "affectionless, unempathetic interpersonal behavior" that inflated aggressive and violent tendencies triggered by vulnerabilities.[8]

Neurophysiological outcomes[edit]
The experience of being in a trauma bond can have adverse neurological and neurophysiological outcomes. The body of the victim of a trauma bond is in a perpetual 'fight-or-flight' response state, which can increase cortisol levels that can have a cascading effect and trigger other hormones. 
Persistent, chronic stress can also hamper the cellular response in the body, thereby negatively impacting immunity, organ health, mood, energy levels, and more.[1] In the long run, this can cause epigenetic changes as well. Furthermore, a study conducted in 2015 found that establishing a trauma bond in infancy is also linked with amygdala dysfunction, neurobehavioral deficits, and increased vulnerability to psychiatric disorders later on in life.[30] Psychological abuse is correlated with sleep-related impairments. Disruption in sleep patterns leads to adverse neurophysiological problems, such as an increase in anxiety and irritability. For victims of psychological abuse, the increase in cortisol affects the brain in such a manner that it allows the trauma bonding to be strengthened.[31]

Adverse mental health outcomes[edit]
Trauma bonding is linked to several adverse mental health and well-being outcomes. Due to the abuse and the emotional dependence on their abusers, victims tend to develop an incredibly negative self-image. "Controlling, restricting, degrading, isolating, or dominating" abuse has a crippling effect on the self-image and self-esteem of the abused, and this psychological abuse is far more dangerous than physical abuse.[5] In a 2010 study on battered women labeling themselves as "stupid", researchers found that victims who felt like they allowed themselves to be mistreated and victims who stayed in abusive relationships labeled themselves as "stupid" for doing so.[10] This further contributes to a negative self-image and the maintenance of low self-esteem, both of which foster a poor self-concept, which, in turn, adversely impacts mental well-being. The same was observed in the case study mentioned previously on grooming.[25]
Trauma bonding can also lead to dissociative symptoms that could be a self-preservation and/or coping mechanism. Neurobiological changes can also affect brain development and hamper learning. The internalization of psychological manipulation and trauma can cause anxiety and increase the likelihood of engaging in risk-taking behaviors.[1] Furthermore, the isolation involved in trauma bonding can foster a generally skewed sense of trust, making victims vulnerable to situations that may retraumatize or revictimize them. Victims may also tend to either completely dismiss or minimize dangerous, damaging behaviors and violence around them.[1]
Trauma bonds in parent-child relationships (wherein the child is the victim and the parent is the abuser) can also lead to depressive symptoms later in life.[9] In a 2017 study exploring this, it was found that an "affectionless control" parenting style, characterized by high protection and low care from parents, was a major predictor of depressive symptomology for the victim. In other words, the presence of poor parental bonding coupled with childhood trauma bonds increased the likelihood of the child developing depressive symptoms in the future. A negative self-image is formed when feelings of inadequacy and hopelessness persist and are reinforced by caregivers. Perpetual efforts to seek secure emotional attachments reap no rewards, and a trauma bond facilitates a negative core schema that influences perceptions and interactions throughout one's life.[9] This can give rise to mental health issues such as depression, bipolar disorder, mania, suicidality, and substance abuse that can be pervasive and lifelong.

017. The pervasiveness of learning something through intermittent reinforcement can be elucidated by drawing from learning theory and the behaviorist perspective. In the presence of an aversive stimulus, reinforcement through rewards in unpredictable ways is a key component of learning. When the learner is unable to predict when they will get the reward, learning is maximized. Similarly, the intermittent expressions of affection and care are unexpected, and the inability to predict them makes them more sought after. Intermittent reinforcement produces behavioral patterns that are tough to terminate. Thus, they develop incredibly strong emotional bonds.[2]通过间歇性强化学习某事的普遍性可以通过学习理论和行为主义的观点来阐明。在存在厌恶刺激的情况下，通过以不可预测的方式奖励进行强化是学习的关键组成部分。当学习者无法预测他们何时会获得奖励时，学习就会最大化。同样，断断续续的爱意和关怀表达也是出乎意料的，无法预测也让它们更加受到追捧。间歇性强化会产生难以终止的行为模式。因此，他们建立了令人难以置信的强烈情感纽带。[2]

018. Maintenance  保养

019. A trauma bond can be maintained by keeping the power imbalance and the intermittency of abuse intact.
通过保持权力不平衡和虐待的间歇性完好无损，可以维持创伤纽带。Trauma bonds can also be maintained if the victim is financially dependent on the abuser or has some investment in the relationship, such as a child with the abuser.[6]如果受害者在经济上依赖施虐者或对这种关系有一些投资，例如与施虐者的孩子，也可以维持创伤纽带。[6]
Cognitive dissonance theory can also explain the maintenance of a trauma bond; it postulates that when individuals experience a conflict between their beliefs and actions, they are motivated to reduce or eliminate the incongruence to minimize the psychological discomfort. In this vein, victims may distort their cognition about the trauma and violence of the relationship to maintain a positive view of the relationship. This can involve rationalizing the abuser's behavior, justifications, minimizing the impact of the abuser's violence, and/or self-blaming.[6]认知失调理论也可以解释创伤纽带的维持;它假设，当个人经历他们的信念和行为之间的冲突时，他们有动力减少或消除不一致，以尽量减少心理不适。在这种精神下，受害者可能会扭曲他们对关系的创伤和暴力的认知，以保持对关系的积极看法。这可能涉及合理化施虐者的行为、理由、尽量减少施虐者暴力的影响和/或自责。[6]
Furthermore, research shows that the memory of instances wherein abuse was experienced is dissociated or state-dependent, meaning that the memories of abuse only fully resurface when the situation is similar in intensity and experience to the original situation of terror.[19]此外，研究表明，遭受虐待的记忆是分离的或依赖于状态的，这意味着只有当情况的强度和经历与最初的恐怖情况相似时，虐待的记忆才会完全重新出现。[19]
If and when the victim finally decides to leave the abusive relationship, the immediate relief from the traumatizing violence will begin to abate, and the underlying, deep attachment formed from intermittent reinforcement will begin to surface. This current period of vulnerability and emotional exhaustion will likely trigger memories of when the abuser was temporarily affectionate and caring. In the desire to receive that affection once more, the victim may try to return to the abusive relationship.[12][2]如果受害者最终决定离开虐待关系，那么从创伤性暴力中得到的直接缓解将开始减弱，而间歇性强化形成的潜在的、深层的依恋将开始浮出水面。当前的脆弱和情绪疲惫的时期可能会引发施虐者暂时深情和关怀的记忆。为了再次获得这种感情，受害者可能会试图回到虐待关系中。[12][2]
Strong social support, however, can be a protective factor in preserving the victim's functioning and providing a buffer in traumatic situations.[20]然而，强有力的社会支持可以成为保护受害者功能并在创伤情况下提供缓冲的保护因素。[20]

The role of attachment  依恋的作用[edit]
John Bowlby maintained that secure attachment was an evolutionary human need that superseded even the need for food and reproduction.[2] Attachment has been explored in depth in caregiver-child dynamics, but recent research has shown that the principles that explain attachment between caregivers and infants can also explain attachment throughout one's life span, specifically in the context of intimate relationships and romantic bonds.[21]约翰·鲍尔比坚持认为，安全依恋是人类进化的一种需求，甚至取代了对食物和繁殖的需求。[2] 依恋在照顾者与儿童的动态中得到了深入的探讨，但最近的研究表明，解释照顾者和婴儿之间依恋的原则也可以解释一个人一生中的依恋，特别是在亲密关系和浪漫纽带的背景下。[21]
Attachment bonds formed during early life lay the foundation for interpersonal relationships, interactions, personality characteristics, and mental health in the future.[22] Infants usually form attachments with their parents or immediate caregivers. Harlow's research on monkeys shows that infant monkeys form attachment bonds even with abusive mothers (in the experimental setup, the abusive 'mother' was a monkey made out of fabric who delivered mild shocks to the infant monkey or flung the infant monkey across the arena). 
早年形成的依恋纽带为未来的人际关系、互动、性格特征和心理健康奠定了基础。[22] 婴儿通常与父母或直接照顾者形成依恋。 哈洛对猴子的研究表明，即使与虐待的母亲，幼猴也会形成依恋纽带（在实验设置中，虐待的“母亲”是一只由织物制成的猴子，它对幼猴进行轻微的电击或将幼猴扔过竞技场）。These findings also apply to human attachment bonds. Even in situations where immediate caregivers are abusive, human infants still tend to attach to them; rejection from a caregiver only enhances the efforts to increase proximity to them and establish an attachment bond with them.[19]
Furthermore, in situations of danger, humans seek increased attachment. When ordinary pathways of attachment are unavailable, people tend to turn to their abusers. This leads to strong bonds and deep emotional connections with abusers. This attachment—both to abusive caregivers and to other abusers in the absence of a main caregiver—may be adaptive in the short run as it may aid survival. But in the long run, this attachment is maladaptive and can lay the foundation for, increase vulnerability to, and even directly lead to trauma bonding.

Stockholm syndrome[edit]
The concept of trauma bonding is often conflated with Stockholm syndrome. Although there are overarching similarities between the two, especially in the context of developing an emotional bond with one's abuser, trauma bonding and Stockholm syndrome are distinct from one another. The main difference is the direction of the relationship.[1]
In other words, in the case of Stockholm syndrome, the emotional connection is reciprocal, such that the abuser also appears to develop an emotional connection towards the abused and harbor positive feelings for the abused, in addition to the abused developing an emotional bond with the abuser.[1]

Realms of existence[edit]

In abusive relationships[edit]


Although the victim may disclose the abuse, the trauma bond means that the victim may wish to receive comfort from the very person who abused them.


PACE UK[23]
Unhealthy, or traumatic, bonding occurs between people in an abusive relationship. The bond is stronger for people who have grown up in abusive households and who believe abuse to be a normal part of relationships.[13] On the psychometric scale for Stockholm syndrome, the three main components are: justifying an abuser through cognitive distortions, damage, ongoing psychological effects of abuse, and love.[6]
Initially, the abuser is inconsistent in approach, increasing in intensity over time. As the bond progresses, it may become more difficult for victims to leave abusers with whom they have bonded.[13]
Fear, children, and financial constraints may be factors preventing victims from leaving abusive relationships.[24]

Battered women[edit]
Initial research about battered women held the view that a victim's return to an abusive relationship was an indicator of a flawed personality and, more specifically, masochism.[12] However, this view was perpetuated by the 'just-world fallacy', the cognitive bias towards the idea that people "get what is coming for them". The tendency to victim-blame arises from the belief that the world is a just and fair place where the victim is seen as deserving of any negative consequences. However, research on battered women and research on traumatic bonding have shown that that is not the case. In terms of battered women's decision to stay in or return to an abusive relationship, many factors are at play, ranging from family history and role expectations to access to resources to the dynamics of the relationship itself.[12] A crucial part of the relationship's dynamic is the existence of a trauma bond. Maltreatment interspersed with periods of kindness aids in the formation of a trauma bond that makes the victim harbor positive feelings towards the abuser.[12]
Among battered women, a three-phase process can explain the intermittent reward-punishment cycle. During phase one, there is a gradual increase in tension, followed by an "explosive battering incident" in phase two, which is then followed by a peaceful expression of love and affection from the abuser during phase three. These phases' recurring and cyclical nature gives rise to a trauma bond.[2]

Sex trafficking[edit]
Trauma bonds are extremely common in situations of sex trafficking, child grooming, commercial sexual exploitation of children (CSEC), and pimp-prostitute relationships.

Grooming[edit]
Child grooming involves establishing and maintaining trauma bonds between the child and the abuser. Along with the factors of power imbalance and intermittent reinforcement that contribute to trauma bonding, child grooming also necessitates gaining the trust of those around the child. Grooming also involves gaining the child's trust while simultaneously violating their boundaries. Treats and trips are used as bribes to both gain access to the child as well as ensure that they comply.[25] Intense attachments coupled with cognitive distortions deepen the bond.
A 2019 case study explores the life of one individual who was groomed. The victim's perception of the abuser as a benefactor, a substitute parent, and a mind controller all contributed to the development of a traumatic bond between the victim and the abuser.[25] In terms of being a benefactor, the abuser in this case study went above and beyond to give the victim what they needed. From getting the victim a job to gifting them a plot of land for their first house, the abuser was always present as a benefactor. The abuser also acted as a substitute parent, advising and offering emotional support in times of crisis. The roles of the abuser as a benefactor and substitute parent constituted the good treatment necessary to establish a trauma bond. In contrast, the abuser's role as a mind controller involved controlling and dominating tendencies that emulated being brainwashed.[25] This combination of perceptions established a traumatic bond that the victim found incredibly difficult to break because rejecting the emotional connection as a whole would also involve rejecting the perks and benefits—the trips, the gifts, the treats, the confidante, and the caretaker.
Child grooming can be understood from a developmental perspective as well, and the relationship between the victim and the abuser evolves across the lifespan. Grooming starts when the child is extremely young—the trust of the child and the family is acquired. The child is given immense attention and is showered with gifts.[25] As the individual matures and enters adolescence, the abuser becomes a confidante and a benefactor. In the case study mentioned previously, the abuser gave the victim career advice, picked him up, and dropped him off at school. Then, at the onset of adulthood, the abuser provided the victim with land to build their home and became the person the victim brought their partner home to. As the victim's developmental needs evolved, so did the abuser's response, such that the only thing constant was the victim's need for affection. In other words, the abuser was "able to capitalize on [the victim's] relational needs" until the victim was able to meet those needs in other ways.[25]

Commercial sexual exploitation of children (CSEC)[edit]
The commercial sexual exploitation of children (CSEC) can cause debilitating physical and psychological trauma. Along with causing functional impairments, it can amplify risk-taking behaviors and increase impulse dysregulation, further compromising the child's ability to conceptualize, comprehend, establish, and maintain boundaries. This can lead to confusion regarding what safety, affection, intimacy, and kindness entail, resulting in the formation of a trauma bond with the abuser or trafficker that is based on skewed perceptions of safety and kindness.[1] The trauma bond deepens and strengthens when isolation and threats to survival increase, forcing the victim to depend almost entirely on the abuser for survival and protection. This increased emotional dependence on the abuser normalizes the emotional violence experienced by the victim at the hands of the abuser, and gradually, the victim develops a sense of trust and safety, albeit skewed, towards the abuser.[1]

Trauma-coercive bond[edit]
Trauma bonding thrives in the presence of a power imbalance and intermittent reward/punishment behavior. Trauma-coercive bonding, on the other hand, has two additional elements: social isolation and the perceived inability to escape the situation. Since these two elements are crucial to the experiences of victims of CSEC, their bonds with their abusers are better described as trauma-coercive bonds rather than simply as trauma bonds. The element of coercion concreted by social isolation and the perceived inability to escape makes the trauma bond more complex and far more deeply rooted.[1] The use of coercive trauma bonding encapsulates the psycho-social dynamics of a relationship between a victim and a perpetrator of CSEC.

Intimate partner violence (IPV)[edit]
IPV has been defined as physical, sexual, psychological, economic, or stalking abuse, both concrete and menaced, perpetuated by current or ex-partners. Trauma bonding is used to solidify this type of relationship by rationalizing and/or minimizing a violent partner's behavior, self-blame, and reporting love in the context of fear.

Parent-child relationships[edit]
Trauma bonds in parent-child or caregiver-child dynamics can be borne from abuse, neglect, or incestuous relationships.[26]

Abuse and/or neglect[edit]
Children of dismissive caregivers or cruel caregivers can develop insecure attachments, which can be very dysfunctional. Inconsistencies in reward and punishment (i.e., intermittent reinforcement of good and bad treatment) can highlight the affection the child receives from the parent, forcing a split between the abuse and the kindness such that the child seeks to form an overall positive view of the caregiver and thus focuses only on the affection and kindness they receive.[15][8] Overall, a trauma bond develops such that the child's sense of self is derived from their emotional dependence on the authority figure, who, in this case, is the parent and/or caregiver.

Incest[edit]
Incestuous relationships between parents and children cultivate trauma bonds similar to those prevalent in victims of sex trafficking. All participants in a 1994 study by Jane Kay Hedberg on trauma in adult incest survivors demonstrated some trauma bonding with their abusers.[27] There was a positive correlation between the pervasiveness of the trauma bond and the amount of contact the victim or the victim's close family members had with the abuser: those who self-reported less pervasive trauma also reported sustained contact with their abuser, while those who self-reported more pervasive trauma demonstrated an active avoidance of maintaining a relationship with their abuser. In incestuous parent-child dynamics, the study found that maintaining an unhealthy relationship with the abuser contributes to trauma and sustains the trauma bond.[27] However, Hedberg cautions against generalizing findings from the study since the sample was small (n = 11) and wasn't representative of the general population of incest survivors.[footnote 1]
This aligns with the idea that trauma bonds are toxic and difficult to leave due to the inherent power imbalance, which, in parent-child relationships, is even more pervasive than in other situations. Incestuous relationships also have an added layer of betrayal trauma, which arises from the exploitation of the victim's trust, resulting in a feeling of betrayal.[22]

Military (tours of duty)[edit]
Trauma bonds can develop in military settings. The literature demonstrates this specifically in the context of tours of duty, wherein military personnel are deployed in hostile environments or areas of combat. A 2019 study exploring this specific phenomenon sought to understand the traumatic bond developed between Japanese soldiers and Korean 'comfort women' in the midst of World War II.[28] The trauma, in this case, was two-fold: not only did the trauma bond develop in an abused-abuser dynamic, but the trauma itself was also a result of and was perpetuated by the war. While the relationships provided the Japanese soldiers with emotional relief and an escape from the violence of the war and the tyranny of the higher-ranking officers, they also provided the Korean 'comfort women' with much-desired protection and kindness from the soldiers.[28]
Soldiers would behave aggressively and violently towards the 'comfort women' and often sexually exploit them. They would use intimidation tactics to assert dominance and foster coercion. However, this abuse would be interspersed with kindness and empathy from the soldiers, whose moods and subsequent behavior and interactions were highly contingent on the time and context of the ongoing war.[28] Nonetheless, the intermittent kindness allowed the formation and maintenance of a trauma bond. Intermittent rewards were sometimes also more tangible, in the form of food, outings, and physical protection. However, protection and emotional support were pivotal in maintaining the trauma bonds and far more important than food and outings. The Korean 'comfort women' eventually came to be emotionally dependent on the Japanese soldiers and began to relate this dependence with their own sense of power, thereby establishing a trauma bond that, for some, persisted even after the war was over.[28]

Outcomes[edit]
Trauma bonding has several short-term and long-term impacts on the abused. It can force people to stay in abusive relationships, negatively affect self-image and self-esteem, perpetuate transgenerational cycles of abuse, and result in adverse mental health outcomes like an increased likelihood of developing depression and/or bipolar disorder.[9][8][5][1]

Staying in abusive relationships[edit]
Owing to the debilitating psychological manipulation involved in the development of a trauma bond, abused people tend to stay in abusive relationships, mainly because the perceived consequences of leaving the relationship seem far more negative than the consequences of staying in the abusive relationship.[6][2]
In such relationships, maltreatment is often interspersed with fragments of solace and peace that involve the expression of love, kindness, affection, and/or general friendliness from the abuser towards the abused.[6] This intermittent reinforcement of a reward (here, the abuser's love and kindness) amidst all the abuse becomes what the victim begins to hold on to. Thus, victims tend to become emotionally dependent on the abuser and construct the belief that their survival is contingent upon receiving the abuser's love.[6] Victims thereby begin to formulate their sense of identity (a form of self) around receiving the abuser's affection, which points to what could be gaslighting. Kindness and affection from the abuser amidst the abuse become a focal point for the victim's emotional dependence. This dependency is characterized by the belief that their survival is contingent on the abuser's love and affection, leading victims to construct their sense of identity and self-worth around this dynamic.[29] Additionally, the provision of intermittent love and affection makes the victim cling to the hope that things can change.[11] Furthermore, self-blame, the fear of social stigma and embarrassment, the fear of loneliness in the absence of a partner, and the lack of or poor social support from other family and friends also contribute to individuals remaining in abusive relationships.[11]

Perpetuation of transgenerational cycles of abuse[edit]
People who have experienced trauma and traumatic bonds can, knowingly or unknowingly, repeat the cycle of abuse. In other words, victims who were traumatically bonded with abusers may grow to become abusers themselves. The abuse that victims inflict may or may not involve trauma bonding.[9]
For instance, in a 2018 study on convicted child murderers, researchers found that caregivers who committed child homicide (murdered their child or care receiver) had experienced traumatic experiences and had trauma bonds with abusers in their early lives.[8] Individuals with cruel and/or dismissive caregivers are likely to develop insecure attachments that result in a host of problems, including emotion deregulation and an attitude of confusion towards the caregiver, who becomes a source of comfort as well as fear. These adverse attachments can manifest in an individual's relationship with their own children as well. Attachment issues and painful memories of trauma bonds with their own caregivers can be triggered, and individuals may demonstrate heightened and disproportionate aggression toward their child, some culminating in homicide.[8] In this study, participants experienced physical abuse, sexual abuse, a lack of protection from external dangers, abandonment, emotional rejection, and more from their caregivers. Nonetheless, participants expressed unconditional love towards their caregivers, justified by wanting to maintain an overall positive view of them.[8] In their continued efforts to form an emotional connection, a trauma bond was fostered. These experiences had a severe negative impact on their relationship and bonding with their own children, contributing to "affectionless, unempathetic interpersonal behavior" that inflated aggressive and violent tendencies triggered by vulnerabilities.[8]

Neurophysiological outcomes[edit]
The experience of being in a trauma bond can have adverse neurological and neurophysiological outcomes. The body of the victim of a trauma bond is in a perpetual 'fight-or-flight' response state, which can increase cortisol levels that can have a cascading effect and trigger other hormones. 
Persistent, chronic stress can also hamper the cellular response in the body, thereby negatively impacting immunity, organ health, mood, energy levels, and more.[1] In the long run, this can cause epigenetic changes as well. Furthermore, a study conducted in 2015 found that establishing a trauma bond in infancy is also linked with amygdala dysfunction, neurobehavioral deficits, and increased vulnerability to psychiatric disorders later on in life.[30] Psychological abuse is correlated with sleep-related impairments. Disruption in sleep patterns leads to adverse neurophysiological problems, such as an increase in anxiety and irritability. For victims of psychological abuse, the increase in cortisol affects the brain in such a manner that it allows the trauma bonding to be strengthened.[31]

Adverse mental health outcomes[edit]
Trauma bonding is linked to several adverse mental health and well-being outcomes. Due to the abuse and the emotional dependence on their abusers, victims tend to develop an incredibly negative self-image. "Controlling, restricting, degrading, isolating, or dominating" abuse has a crippling effect on the self-image and self-esteem of the abused, and this psychological abuse is far more dangerous than physical abuse.[5] In a 2010 study on battered women labeling themselves as "stupid", researchers found that victims who felt like they allowed themselves to be mistreated and victims who stayed in abusive relationships labeled themselves as "stupid" for doing so.[10] This further contributes to a negative self-image and the maintenance of low self-esteem, both of which foster a poor self-concept, which, in turn, adversely impacts mental well-being. The same was observed in the case study mentioned previously on grooming.[25]
Trauma bonding can also lead to dissociative symptoms that could be a self-preservation and/or coping mechanism. Neurobiological changes can also affect brain development and hamper learning. The internalization of psychological manipulation and trauma can cause anxiety and increase the likelihood of engaging in risk-taking behaviors.[1] Furthermore, the isolation involved in trauma bonding can foster a generally skewed sense of trust, making victims vulnerable to situations that may retraumatize or revictimize them. Victims may also tend to either completely dismiss or minimize dangerous, damaging behaviors and violence around them.[1]
Trauma bonds in parent-child relationships (wherein the child is the victim and the parent is the abuser) can also lead to depressive symptoms later in life.[9] In a 2017 study exploring this, it was found that an "affectionless control" parenting style, characterized by high protection and low care from parents, was a major predictor of depressive symptomology for the victim. In other words, the presence of poor parental bonding coupled with childhood trauma bonds increased the likelihood of the child developing depressive symptoms in the future. A negative self-image is formed when feelings of inadequacy and hopelessness persist and are reinforced by caregivers. Perpetual efforts to seek secure emotional attachments reap no rewards, and a trauma bond facilitates a negative core schema that influences perceptions and interactions throughout one's life.[9] This can give rise to mental health issues such as depression, bipolar disorder, mania, suicidality, and substance abuse that can be pervasive and lifelong.

020. Trauma bonds can also be maintained if the victim is financially dependent on the abuser or has some investment in the relationship, such as a child with the abuser.[6]如果受害者在经济上依赖施虐者或对这种关系有一些投资，例如与施虐者的孩子，也可以维持创伤纽带。[6]
Cognitive dissonance theory can also explain the maintenance of a trauma bond; it postulates that when individuals experience a conflict between their beliefs and actions, they are motivated to reduce or eliminate the incongruence to minimize the psychological discomfort. In this vein, victims may distort their cognition about the trauma and violence of the relationship to maintain a positive view of the relationship. This can involve rationalizing the abuser's behavior, justifications, minimizing the impact of the abuser's violence, and/or self-blaming.[6]认知失调理论也可以解释创伤纽带的维持;它假设，当个人经历他们的信念和行为之间的冲突时，他们有动力减少或消除不一致，以尽量减少心理不适。在这种精神下，受害者可能会扭曲他们对关系的创伤和暴力的认知，以保持对关系的积极看法。这可能涉及合理化施虐者的行为、理由、尽量减少施虐者暴力的影响和/或自责。[6]
Furthermore, research shows that the memory of instances wherein abuse was experienced is dissociated or state-dependent, meaning that the memories of abuse only fully resurface when the situation is similar in intensity and experience to the original situation of terror.[19]此外，研究表明，遭受虐待的记忆是分离的或依赖于状态的，这意味着只有当情况的强度和经历与最初的恐怖情况相似时，虐待的记忆才会完全重新出现。[19]
If and when the victim finally decides to leave the abusive relationship, the immediate relief from the traumatizing violence will begin to abate, and the underlying, deep attachment formed from intermittent reinforcement will begin to surface. This current period of vulnerability and emotional exhaustion will likely trigger memories of when the abuser was temporarily affectionate and caring. In the desire to receive that affection once more, the victim may try to return to the abusive relationship.[12][2]如果受害者最终决定离开虐待关系，那么从创伤性暴力中得到的直接缓解将开始减弱，而间歇性强化形成的潜在的、深层的依恋将开始浮出水面。当前的脆弱和情绪疲惫的时期可能会引发施虐者暂时深情和关怀的记忆。为了再次获得这种感情，受害者可能会试图回到虐待关系中。[12][2]
Strong social support, however, can be a protective factor in preserving the victim's functioning and providing a buffer in traumatic situations.[20]然而，强有力的社会支持可以成为保护受害者功能并在创伤情况下提供缓冲的保护因素。[20]

The role of attachment  依恋的作用[edit]
John Bowlby maintained that secure attachment was an evolutionary human need that superseded even the need for food and reproduction.[2] Attachment has been explored in depth in caregiver-child dynamics, but recent research has shown that the principles that explain attachment between caregivers and infants can also explain attachment throughout one's life span, specifically in the context of intimate relationships and romantic bonds.[21]约翰·鲍尔比坚持认为，安全依恋是人类进化的一种需求，甚至取代了对食物和繁殖的需求。[2] 依恋在照顾者与儿童的动态中得到了深入的探讨，但最近的研究表明，解释照顾者和婴儿之间依恋的原则也可以解释一个人一生中的依恋，特别是在亲密关系和浪漫纽带的背景下。[21]
Attachment bonds formed during early life lay the foundation for interpersonal relationships, interactions, personality characteristics, and mental health in the future.[22] Infants usually form attachments with their parents or immediate caregivers. Harlow's research on monkeys shows that infant monkeys form attachment bonds even with abusive mothers (in the experimental setup, the abusive 'mother' was a monkey made out of fabric who delivered mild shocks to the infant monkey or flung the infant monkey across the arena). 
早年形成的依恋纽带为未来的人际关系、互动、性格特征和心理健康奠定了基础。[22] 婴儿通常与父母或直接照顾者形成依恋。 哈洛对猴子的研究表明，即使与虐待的母亲，幼猴也会形成依恋纽带（在实验设置中，虐待的“母亲”是一只由织物制成的猴子，它对幼猴进行轻微的电击或将幼猴扔过竞技场）。These findings also apply to human attachment bonds. Even in situations where immediate caregivers are abusive, human infants still tend to attach to them; rejection from a caregiver only enhances the efforts to increase proximity to them and establish an attachment bond with them.[19]
Furthermore, in situations of danger, humans seek increased attachment. When ordinary pathways of attachment are unavailable, people tend to turn to their abusers. This leads to strong bonds and deep emotional connections with abusers. This attachment—both to abusive caregivers and to other abusers in the absence of a main caregiver—may be adaptive in the short run as it may aid survival. But in the long run, this attachment is maladaptive and can lay the foundation for, increase vulnerability to, and even directly lead to trauma bonding.

Stockholm syndrome[edit]
The concept of trauma bonding is often conflated with Stockholm syndrome. Although there are overarching similarities between the two, especially in the context of developing an emotional bond with one's abuser, trauma bonding and Stockholm syndrome are distinct from one another. The main difference is the direction of the relationship.[1]
In other words, in the case of Stockholm syndrome, the emotional connection is reciprocal, such that the abuser also appears to develop an emotional connection towards the abused and harbor positive feelings for the abused, in addition to the abused developing an emotional bond with the abuser.[1]

Realms of existence[edit]

In abusive relationships[edit]


Although the victim may disclose the abuse, the trauma bond means that the victim may wish to receive comfort from the very person who abused them.


PACE UK[23]
Unhealthy, or traumatic, bonding occurs between people in an abusive relationship. The bond is stronger for people who have grown up in abusive households and who believe abuse to be a normal part of relationships.[13] On the psychometric scale for Stockholm syndrome, the three main components are: justifying an abuser through cognitive distortions, damage, ongoing psychological effects of abuse, and love.[6]
Initially, the abuser is inconsistent in approach, increasing in intensity over time. As the bond progresses, it may become more difficult for victims to leave abusers with whom they have bonded.[13]
Fear, children, and financial constraints may be factors preventing victims from leaving abusive relationships.[24]

Battered women[edit]
Initial research about battered women held the view that a victim's return to an abusive relationship was an indicator of a flawed personality and, more specifically, masochism.[12] However, this view was perpetuated by the 'just-world fallacy', the cognitive bias towards the idea that people "get what is coming for them". The tendency to victim-blame arises from the belief that the world is a just and fair place where the victim is seen as deserving of any negative consequences. However, research on battered women and research on traumatic bonding have shown that that is not the case. In terms of battered women's decision to stay in or return to an abusive relationship, many factors are at play, ranging from family history and role expectations to access to resources to the dynamics of the relationship itself.[12] A crucial part of the relationship's dynamic is the existence of a trauma bond. Maltreatment interspersed with periods of kindness aids in the formation of a trauma bond that makes the victim harbor positive feelings towards the abuser.[12]
Among battered women, a three-phase process can explain the intermittent reward-punishment cycle. During phase one, there is a gradual increase in tension, followed by an "explosive battering incident" in phase two, which is then followed by a peaceful expression of love and affection from the abuser during phase three. These phases' recurring and cyclical nature gives rise to a trauma bond.[2]

Sex trafficking[edit]
Trauma bonds are extremely common in situations of sex trafficking, child grooming, commercial sexual exploitation of children (CSEC), and pimp-prostitute relationships.

Grooming[edit]
Child grooming involves establishing and maintaining trauma bonds between the child and the abuser. Along with the factors of power imbalance and intermittent reinforcement that contribute to trauma bonding, child grooming also necessitates gaining the trust of those around the child. Grooming also involves gaining the child's trust while simultaneously violating their boundaries. Treats and trips are used as bribes to both gain access to the child as well as ensure that they comply.[25] Intense attachments coupled with cognitive distortions deepen the bond.
A 2019 case study explores the life of one individual who was groomed. The victim's perception of the abuser as a benefactor, a substitute parent, and a mind controller all contributed to the development of a traumatic bond between the victim and the abuser.[25] In terms of being a benefactor, the abuser in this case study went above and beyond to give the victim what they needed. From getting the victim a job to gifting them a plot of land for their first house, the abuser was always present as a benefactor. The abuser also acted as a substitute parent, advising and offering emotional support in times of crisis. The roles of the abuser as a benefactor and substitute parent constituted the good treatment necessary to establish a trauma bond. In contrast, the abuser's role as a mind controller involved controlling and dominating tendencies that emulated being brainwashed.[25] This combination of perceptions established a traumatic bond that the victim found incredibly difficult to break because rejecting the emotional connection as a whole would also involve rejecting the perks and benefits—the trips, the gifts, the treats, the confidante, and the caretaker.
Child grooming can be understood from a developmental perspective as well, and the relationship between the victim and the abuser evolves across the lifespan. Grooming starts when the child is extremely young—the trust of the child and the family is acquired. The child is given immense attention and is showered with gifts.[25] As the individual matures and enters adolescence, the abuser becomes a confidante and a benefactor. In the case study mentioned previously, the abuser gave the victim career advice, picked him up, and dropped him off at school. Then, at the onset of adulthood, the abuser provided the victim with land to build their home and became the person the victim brought their partner home to. As the victim's developmental needs evolved, so did the abuser's response, such that the only thing constant was the victim's need for affection. In other words, the abuser was "able to capitalize on [the victim's] relational needs" until the victim was able to meet those needs in other ways.[25]

Commercial sexual exploitation of children (CSEC)[edit]
The commercial sexual exploitation of children (CSEC) can cause debilitating physical and psychological trauma. Along with causing functional impairments, it can amplify risk-taking behaviors and increase impulse dysregulation, further compromising the child's ability to conceptualize, comprehend, establish, and maintain boundaries. This can lead to confusion regarding what safety, affection, intimacy, and kindness entail, resulting in the formation of a trauma bond with the abuser or trafficker that is based on skewed perceptions of safety and kindness.[1] The trauma bond deepens and strengthens when isolation and threats to survival increase, forcing the victim to depend almost entirely on the abuser for survival and protection. This increased emotional dependence on the abuser normalizes the emotional violence experienced by the victim at the hands of the abuser, and gradually, the victim develops a sense of trust and safety, albeit skewed, towards the abuser.[1]

Trauma-coercive bond[edit]
Trauma bonding thrives in the presence of a power imbalance and intermittent reward/punishment behavior. Trauma-coercive bonding, on the other hand, has two additional elements: social isolation and the perceived inability to escape the situation. Since these two elements are crucial to the experiences of victims of CSEC, their bonds with their abusers are better described as trauma-coercive bonds rather than simply as trauma bonds. The element of coercion concreted by social isolation and the perceived inability to escape makes the trauma bond more complex and far more deeply rooted.[1] The use of coercive trauma bonding encapsulates the psycho-social dynamics of a relationship between a victim and a perpetrator of CSEC.

Intimate partner violence (IPV)[edit]
IPV has been defined as physical, sexual, psychological, economic, or stalking abuse, both concrete and menaced, perpetuated by current or ex-partners. Trauma bonding is used to solidify this type of relationship by rationalizing and/or minimizing a violent partner's behavior, self-blame, and reporting love in the context of fear.

Parent-child relationships[edit]
Trauma bonds in parent-child or caregiver-child dynamics can be borne from abuse, neglect, or incestuous relationships.[26]

Abuse and/or neglect[edit]
Children of dismissive caregivers or cruel caregivers can develop insecure attachments, which can be very dysfunctional. Inconsistencies in reward and punishment (i.e., intermittent reinforcement of good and bad treatment) can highlight the affection the child receives from the parent, forcing a split between the abuse and the kindness such that the child seeks to form an overall positive view of the caregiver and thus focuses only on the affection and kindness they receive.[15][8] Overall, a trauma bond develops such that the child's sense of self is derived from their emotional dependence on the authority figure, who, in this case, is the parent and/or caregiver.

Incest[edit]
Incestuous relationships between parents and children cultivate trauma bonds similar to those prevalent in victims of sex trafficking. All participants in a 1994 study by Jane Kay Hedberg on trauma in adult incest survivors demonstrated some trauma bonding with their abusers.[27] There was a positive correlation between the pervasiveness of the trauma bond and the amount of contact the victim or the victim's close family members had with the abuser: those who self-reported less pervasive trauma also reported sustained contact with their abuser, while those who self-reported more pervasive trauma demonstrated an active avoidance of maintaining a relationship with their abuser. In incestuous parent-child dynamics, the study found that maintaining an unhealthy relationship with the abuser contributes to trauma and sustains the trauma bond.[27] However, Hedberg cautions against generalizing findings from the study since the sample was small (n = 11) and wasn't representative of the general population of incest survivors.[footnote 1]
This aligns with the idea that trauma bonds are toxic and difficult to leave due to the inherent power imbalance, which, in parent-child relationships, is even more pervasive than in other situations. Incestuous relationships also have an added layer of betrayal trauma, which arises from the exploitation of the victim's trust, resulting in a feeling of betrayal.[22]

Military (tours of duty)[edit]
Trauma bonds can develop in military settings. The literature demonstrates this specifically in the context of tours of duty, wherein military personnel are deployed in hostile environments or areas of combat. A 2019 study exploring this specific phenomenon sought to understand the traumatic bond developed between Japanese soldiers and Korean 'comfort women' in the midst of World War II.[28] The trauma, in this case, was two-fold: not only did the trauma bond develop in an abused-abuser dynamic, but the trauma itself was also a result of and was perpetuated by the war. While the relationships provided the Japanese soldiers with emotional relief and an escape from the violence of the war and the tyranny of the higher-ranking officers, they also provided the Korean 'comfort women' with much-desired protection and kindness from the soldiers.[28]
Soldiers would behave aggressively and violently towards the 'comfort women' and often sexually exploit them. They would use intimidation tactics to assert dominance and foster coercion. However, this abuse would be interspersed with kindness and empathy from the soldiers, whose moods and subsequent behavior and interactions were highly contingent on the time and context of the ongoing war.[28] Nonetheless, the intermittent kindness allowed the formation and maintenance of a trauma bond. Intermittent rewards were sometimes also more tangible, in the form of food, outings, and physical protection. However, protection and emotional support were pivotal in maintaining the trauma bonds and far more important than food and outings. The Korean 'comfort women' eventually came to be emotionally dependent on the Japanese soldiers and began to relate this dependence with their own sense of power, thereby establishing a trauma bond that, for some, persisted even after the war was over.[28]

Outcomes[edit]
Trauma bonding has several short-term and long-term impacts on the abused. It can force people to stay in abusive relationships, negatively affect self-image and self-esteem, perpetuate transgenerational cycles of abuse, and result in adverse mental health outcomes like an increased likelihood of developing depression and/or bipolar disorder.[9][8][5][1]

Staying in abusive relationships[edit]
Owing to the debilitating psychological manipulation involved in the development of a trauma bond, abused people tend to stay in abusive relationships, mainly because the perceived consequences of leaving the relationship seem far more negative than the consequences of staying in the abusive relationship.[6][2]
In such relationships, maltreatment is often interspersed with fragments of solace and peace that involve the expression of love, kindness, affection, and/or general friendliness from the abuser towards the abused.[6] This intermittent reinforcement of a reward (here, the abuser's love and kindness) amidst all the abuse becomes what the victim begins to hold on to. Thus, victims tend to become emotionally dependent on the abuser and construct the belief that their survival is contingent upon receiving the abuser's love.[6] Victims thereby begin to formulate their sense of identity (a form of self) around receiving the abuser's affection, which points to what could be gaslighting. Kindness and affection from the abuser amidst the abuse become a focal point for the victim's emotional dependence. This dependency is characterized by the belief that their survival is contingent on the abuser's love and affection, leading victims to construct their sense of identity and self-worth around this dynamic.[29] Additionally, the provision of intermittent love and affection makes the victim cling to the hope that things can change.[11] Furthermore, self-blame, the fear of social stigma and embarrassment, the fear of loneliness in the absence of a partner, and the lack of or poor social support from other family and friends also contribute to individuals remaining in abusive relationships.[11]

Perpetuation of transgenerational cycles of abuse[edit]
People who have experienced trauma and traumatic bonds can, knowingly or unknowingly, repeat the cycle of abuse. In other words, victims who were traumatically bonded with abusers may grow to become abusers themselves. The abuse that victims inflict may or may not involve trauma bonding.[9]
For instance, in a 2018 study on convicted child murderers, researchers found that caregivers who committed child homicide (murdered their child or care receiver) had experienced traumatic experiences and had trauma bonds with abusers in their early lives.[8] Individuals with cruel and/or dismissive caregivers are likely to develop insecure attachments that result in a host of problems, including emotion deregulation and an attitude of confusion towards the caregiver, who becomes a source of comfort as well as fear. These adverse attachments can manifest in an individual's relationship with their own children as well. Attachment issues and painful memories of trauma bonds with their own caregivers can be triggered, and individuals may demonstrate heightened and disproportionate aggression toward their child, some culminating in homicide.[8] In this study, participants experienced physical abuse, sexual abuse, a lack of protection from external dangers, abandonment, emotional rejection, and more from their caregivers. Nonetheless, participants expressed unconditional love towards their caregivers, justified by wanting to maintain an overall positive view of them.[8] In their continued efforts to form an emotional connection, a trauma bond was fostered. These experiences had a severe negative impact on their relationship and bonding with their own children, contributing to "affectionless, unempathetic interpersonal behavior" that inflated aggressive and violent tendencies triggered by vulnerabilities.[8]

Neurophysiological outcomes[edit]
The experience of being in a trauma bond can have adverse neurological and neurophysiological outcomes. The body of the victim of a trauma bond is in a perpetual 'fight-or-flight' response state, which can increase cortisol levels that can have a cascading effect and trigger other hormones. 
Persistent, chronic stress can also hamper the cellular response in the body, thereby negatively impacting immunity, organ health, mood, energy levels, and more.[1] In the long run, this can cause epigenetic changes as well. Furthermore, a study conducted in 2015 found that establishing a trauma bond in infancy is also linked with amygdala dysfunction, neurobehavioral deficits, and increased vulnerability to psychiatric disorders later on in life.[30] Psychological abuse is correlated with sleep-related impairments. Disruption in sleep patterns leads to adverse neurophysiological problems, such as an increase in anxiety and irritability. For victims of psychological abuse, the increase in cortisol affects the brain in such a manner that it allows the trauma bonding to be strengthened.[31]

Adverse mental health outcomes[edit]
Trauma bonding is linked to several adverse mental health and well-being outcomes. Due to the abuse and the emotional dependence on their abusers, victims tend to develop an incredibly negative self-image. "Controlling, restricting, degrading, isolating, or dominating" abuse has a crippling effect on the self-image and self-esteem of the abused, and this psychological abuse is far more dangerous than physical abuse.[5] In a 2010 study on battered women labeling themselves as "stupid", researchers found that victims who felt like they allowed themselves to be mistreated and victims who stayed in abusive relationships labeled themselves as "stupid" for doing so.[10] This further contributes to a negative self-image and the maintenance of low self-esteem, both of which foster a poor self-concept, which, in turn, adversely impacts mental well-being. The same was observed in the case study mentioned previously on grooming.[25]
Trauma bonding can also lead to dissociative symptoms that could be a self-preservation and/or coping mechanism. Neurobiological changes can also affect brain development and hamper learning. The internalization of psychological manipulation and trauma can cause anxiety and increase the likelihood of engaging in risk-taking behaviors.[1] Furthermore, the isolation involved in trauma bonding can foster a generally skewed sense of trust, making victims vulnerable to situations that may retraumatize or revictimize them. Victims may also tend to either completely dismiss or minimize dangerous, damaging behaviors and violence around them.[1]
Trauma bonds in parent-child relationships (wherein the child is the victim and the parent is the abuser) can also lead to depressive symptoms later in life.[9] In a 2017 study exploring this, it was found that an "affectionless control" parenting style, characterized by high protection and low care from parents, was a major predictor of depressive symptomology for the victim. In other words, the presence of poor parental bonding coupled with childhood trauma bonds increased the likelihood of the child developing depressive symptoms in the future. A negative self-image is formed when feelings of inadequacy and hopelessness persist and are reinforced by caregivers. Perpetual efforts to seek secure emotional attachments reap no rewards, and a trauma bond facilitates a negative core schema that influences perceptions and interactions throughout one's life.[9] This can give rise to mental health issues such as depression, bipolar disorder, mania, suicidality, and substance abuse that can be pervasive and lifelong.

021. Cognitive dissonance theory can also explain the maintenance of a trauma bond; it postulates that when individuals experience a conflict between their beliefs and actions, they are motivated to reduce or eliminate the incongruence to minimize the psychological discomfort. In this vein, victims may distort their cognition about the trauma and violence of the relationship to maintain a positive view of the relationship. This can involve rationalizing the abuser's behavior, justifications, minimizing the impact of the abuser's violence, and/or self-blaming.[6]认知失调理论也可以解释创伤纽带的维持;它假设，当个人经历他们的信念和行为之间的冲突时，他们有动力减少或消除不一致，以尽量减少心理不适。在这种精神下，受害者可能会扭曲他们对关系的创伤和暴力的认知，以保持对关系的积极看法。这可能涉及合理化施虐者的行为、理由、尽量减少施虐者暴力的影响和/或自责。[6]
Furthermore, research shows that the memory of instances wherein abuse was experienced is dissociated or state-dependent, meaning that the memories of abuse only fully resurface when the situation is similar in intensity and experience to the original situation of terror.[19]此外，研究表明，遭受虐待的记忆是分离的或依赖于状态的，这意味着只有当情况的强度和经历与最初的恐怖情况相似时，虐待的记忆才会完全重新出现。[19]
If and when the victim finally decides to leave the abusive relationship, the immediate relief from the traumatizing violence will begin to abate, and the underlying, deep attachment formed from intermittent reinforcement will begin to surface. This current period of vulnerability and emotional exhaustion will likely trigger memories of when the abuser was temporarily affectionate and caring. In the desire to receive that affection once more, the victim may try to return to the abusive relationship.[12][2]如果受害者最终决定离开虐待关系，那么从创伤性暴力中得到的直接缓解将开始减弱，而间歇性强化形成的潜在的、深层的依恋将开始浮出水面。当前的脆弱和情绪疲惫的时期可能会引发施虐者暂时深情和关怀的记忆。为了再次获得这种感情，受害者可能会试图回到虐待关系中。[12][2]
Strong social support, however, can be a protective factor in preserving the victim's functioning and providing a buffer in traumatic situations.[20]然而，强有力的社会支持可以成为保护受害者功能并在创伤情况下提供缓冲的保护因素。[20]

The role of attachment  依恋的作用[edit]
John Bowlby maintained that secure attachment was an evolutionary human need that superseded even the need for food and reproduction.[2] Attachment has been explored in depth in caregiver-child dynamics, but recent research has shown that the principles that explain attachment between caregivers and infants can also explain attachment throughout one's life span, specifically in the context of intimate relationships and romantic bonds.[21]约翰·鲍尔比坚持认为，安全依恋是人类进化的一种需求，甚至取代了对食物和繁殖的需求。[2] 依恋在照顾者与儿童的动态中得到了深入的探讨，但最近的研究表明，解释照顾者和婴儿之间依恋的原则也可以解释一个人一生中的依恋，特别是在亲密关系和浪漫纽带的背景下。[21]
Attachment bonds formed during early life lay the foundation for interpersonal relationships, interactions, personality characteristics, and mental health in the future.[22] Infants usually form attachments with their parents or immediate caregivers. Harlow's research on monkeys shows that infant monkeys form attachment bonds even with abusive mothers (in the experimental setup, the abusive 'mother' was a monkey made out of fabric who delivered mild shocks to the infant monkey or flung the infant monkey across the arena). 
早年形成的依恋纽带为未来的人际关系、互动、性格特征和心理健康奠定了基础。[22] 婴儿通常与父母或直接照顾者形成依恋。 哈洛对猴子的研究表明，即使与虐待的母亲，幼猴也会形成依恋纽带（在实验设置中，虐待的“母亲”是一只由织物制成的猴子，它对幼猴进行轻微的电击或将幼猴扔过竞技场）。These findings also apply to human attachment bonds. Even in situations where immediate caregivers are abusive, human infants still tend to attach to them; rejection from a caregiver only enhances the efforts to increase proximity to them and establish an attachment bond with them.[19]
Furthermore, in situations of danger, humans seek increased attachment. When ordinary pathways of attachment are unavailable, people tend to turn to their abusers. This leads to strong bonds and deep emotional connections with abusers. This attachment—both to abusive caregivers and to other abusers in the absence of a main caregiver—may be adaptive in the short run as it may aid survival. But in the long run, this attachment is maladaptive and can lay the foundation for, increase vulnerability to, and even directly lead to trauma bonding.

Stockholm syndrome[edit]
The concept of trauma bonding is often conflated with Stockholm syndrome. Although there are overarching similarities between the two, especially in the context of developing an emotional bond with one's abuser, trauma bonding and Stockholm syndrome are distinct from one another. The main difference is the direction of the relationship.[1]
In other words, in the case of Stockholm syndrome, the emotional connection is reciprocal, such that the abuser also appears to develop an emotional connection towards the abused and harbor positive feelings for the abused, in addition to the abused developing an emotional bond with the abuser.[1]

Realms of existence[edit]

In abusive relationships[edit]


Although the victim may disclose the abuse, the trauma bond means that the victim may wish to receive comfort from the very person who abused them.


PACE UK[23]
Unhealthy, or traumatic, bonding occurs between people in an abusive relationship. The bond is stronger for people who have grown up in abusive households and who believe abuse to be a normal part of relationships.[13] On the psychometric scale for Stockholm syndrome, the three main components are: justifying an abuser through cognitive distortions, damage, ongoing psychological effects of abuse, and love.[6]
Initially, the abuser is inconsistent in approach, increasing in intensity over time. As the bond progresses, it may become more difficult for victims to leave abusers with whom they have bonded.[13]
Fear, children, and financial constraints may be factors preventing victims from leaving abusive relationships.[24]

Battered women[edit]
Initial research about battered women held the view that a victim's return to an abusive relationship was an indicator of a flawed personality and, more specifically, masochism.[12] However, this view was perpetuated by the 'just-world fallacy', the cognitive bias towards the idea that people "get what is coming for them". The tendency to victim-blame arises from the belief that the world is a just and fair place where the victim is seen as deserving of any negative consequences. However, research on battered women and research on traumatic bonding have shown that that is not the case. In terms of battered women's decision to stay in or return to an abusive relationship, many factors are at play, ranging from family history and role expectations to access to resources to the dynamics of the relationship itself.[12] A crucial part of the relationship's dynamic is the existence of a trauma bond. Maltreatment interspersed with periods of kindness aids in the formation of a trauma bond that makes the victim harbor positive feelings towards the abuser.[12]
Among battered women, a three-phase process can explain the intermittent reward-punishment cycle. During phase one, there is a gradual increase in tension, followed by an "explosive battering incident" in phase two, which is then followed by a peaceful expression of love and affection from the abuser during phase three. These phases' recurring and cyclical nature gives rise to a trauma bond.[2]

Sex trafficking[edit]
Trauma bonds are extremely common in situations of sex trafficking, child grooming, commercial sexual exploitation of children (CSEC), and pimp-prostitute relationships.

Grooming[edit]
Child grooming involves establishing and maintaining trauma bonds between the child and the abuser. Along with the factors of power imbalance and intermittent reinforcement that contribute to trauma bonding, child grooming also necessitates gaining the trust of those around the child. Grooming also involves gaining the child's trust while simultaneously violating their boundaries. Treats and trips are used as bribes to both gain access to the child as well as ensure that they comply.[25] Intense attachments coupled with cognitive distortions deepen the bond.
A 2019 case study explores the life of one individual who was groomed. The victim's perception of the abuser as a benefactor, a substitute parent, and a mind controller all contributed to the development of a traumatic bond between the victim and the abuser.[25] In terms of being a benefactor, the abuser in this case study went above and beyond to give the victim what they needed. From getting the victim a job to gifting them a plot of land for their first house, the abuser was always present as a benefactor. The abuser also acted as a substitute parent, advising and offering emotional support in times of crisis. The roles of the abuser as a benefactor and substitute parent constituted the good treatment necessary to establish a trauma bond. In contrast, the abuser's role as a mind controller involved controlling and dominating tendencies that emulated being brainwashed.[25] This combination of perceptions established a traumatic bond that the victim found incredibly difficult to break because rejecting the emotional connection as a whole would also involve rejecting the perks and benefits—the trips, the gifts, the treats, the confidante, and the caretaker.
Child grooming can be understood from a developmental perspective as well, and the relationship between the victim and the abuser evolves across the lifespan. Grooming starts when the child is extremely young—the trust of the child and the family is acquired. The child is given immense attention and is showered with gifts.[25] As the individual matures and enters adolescence, the abuser becomes a confidante and a benefactor. In the case study mentioned previously, the abuser gave the victim career advice, picked him up, and dropped him off at school. Then, at the onset of adulthood, the abuser provided the victim with land to build their home and became the person the victim brought their partner home to. As the victim's developmental needs evolved, so did the abuser's response, such that the only thing constant was the victim's need for affection. In other words, the abuser was "able to capitalize on [the victim's] relational needs" until the victim was able to meet those needs in other ways.[25]

Commercial sexual exploitation of children (CSEC)[edit]
The commercial sexual exploitation of children (CSEC) can cause debilitating physical and psychological trauma. Along with causing functional impairments, it can amplify risk-taking behaviors and increase impulse dysregulation, further compromising the child's ability to conceptualize, comprehend, establish, and maintain boundaries. This can lead to confusion regarding what safety, affection, intimacy, and kindness entail, resulting in the formation of a trauma bond with the abuser or trafficker that is based on skewed perceptions of safety and kindness.[1] The trauma bond deepens and strengthens when isolation and threats to survival increase, forcing the victim to depend almost entirely on the abuser for survival and protection. This increased emotional dependence on the abuser normalizes the emotional violence experienced by the victim at the hands of the abuser, and gradually, the victim develops a sense of trust and safety, albeit skewed, towards the abuser.[1]

Trauma-coercive bond[edit]
Trauma bonding thrives in the presence of a power imbalance and intermittent reward/punishment behavior. Trauma-coercive bonding, on the other hand, has two additional elements: social isolation and the perceived inability to escape the situation. Since these two elements are crucial to the experiences of victims of CSEC, their bonds with their abusers are better described as trauma-coercive bonds rather than simply as trauma bonds. The element of coercion concreted by social isolation and the perceived inability to escape makes the trauma bond more complex and far more deeply rooted.[1] The use of coercive trauma bonding encapsulates the psycho-social dynamics of a relationship between a victim and a perpetrator of CSEC.

Intimate partner violence (IPV)[edit]
IPV has been defined as physical, sexual, psychological, economic, or stalking abuse, both concrete and menaced, perpetuated by current or ex-partners. Trauma bonding is used to solidify this type of relationship by rationalizing and/or minimizing a violent partner's behavior, self-blame, and reporting love in the context of fear.

Parent-child relationships[edit]
Trauma bonds in parent-child or caregiver-child dynamics can be borne from abuse, neglect, or incestuous relationships.[26]

Abuse and/or neglect[edit]
Children of dismissive caregivers or cruel caregivers can develop insecure attachments, which can be very dysfunctional. Inconsistencies in reward and punishment (i.e., intermittent reinforcement of good and bad treatment) can highlight the affection the child receives from the parent, forcing a split between the abuse and the kindness such that the child seeks to form an overall positive view of the caregiver and thus focuses only on the affection and kindness they receive.[15][8] Overall, a trauma bond develops such that the child's sense of self is derived from their emotional dependence on the authority figure, who, in this case, is the parent and/or caregiver.

Incest[edit]
Incestuous relationships between parents and children cultivate trauma bonds similar to those prevalent in victims of sex trafficking. All participants in a 1994 study by Jane Kay Hedberg on trauma in adult incest survivors demonstrated some trauma bonding with their abusers.[27] There was a positive correlation between the pervasiveness of the trauma bond and the amount of contact the victim or the victim's close family members had with the abuser: those who self-reported less pervasive trauma also reported sustained contact with their abuser, while those who self-reported more pervasive trauma demonstrated an active avoidance of maintaining a relationship with their abuser. In incestuous parent-child dynamics, the study found that maintaining an unhealthy relationship with the abuser contributes to trauma and sustains the trauma bond.[27] However, Hedberg cautions against generalizing findings from the study since the sample was small (n = 11) and wasn't representative of the general population of incest survivors.[footnote 1]
This aligns with the idea that trauma bonds are toxic and difficult to leave due to the inherent power imbalance, which, in parent-child relationships, is even more pervasive than in other situations. Incestuous relationships also have an added layer of betrayal trauma, which arises from the exploitation of the victim's trust, resulting in a feeling of betrayal.[22]

Military (tours of duty)[edit]
Trauma bonds can develop in military settings. The literature demonstrates this specifically in the context of tours of duty, wherein military personnel are deployed in hostile environments or areas of combat. A 2019 study exploring this specific phenomenon sought to understand the traumatic bond developed between Japanese soldiers and Korean 'comfort women' in the midst of World War II.[28] The trauma, in this case, was two-fold: not only did the trauma bond develop in an abused-abuser dynamic, but the trauma itself was also a result of and was perpetuated by the war. While the relationships provided the Japanese soldiers with emotional relief and an escape from the violence of the war and the tyranny of the higher-ranking officers, they also provided the Korean 'comfort women' with much-desired protection and kindness from the soldiers.[28]
Soldiers would behave aggressively and violently towards the 'comfort women' and often sexually exploit them. They would use intimidation tactics to assert dominance and foster coercion. However, this abuse would be interspersed with kindness and empathy from the soldiers, whose moods and subsequent behavior and interactions were highly contingent on the time and context of the ongoing war.[28] Nonetheless, the intermittent kindness allowed the formation and maintenance of a trauma bond. Intermittent rewards were sometimes also more tangible, in the form of food, outings, and physical protection. However, protection and emotional support were pivotal in maintaining the trauma bonds and far more important than food and outings. The Korean 'comfort women' eventually came to be emotionally dependent on the Japanese soldiers and began to relate this dependence with their own sense of power, thereby establishing a trauma bond that, for some, persisted even after the war was over.[28]

Outcomes[edit]
Trauma bonding has several short-term and long-term impacts on the abused. It can force people to stay in abusive relationships, negatively affect self-image and self-esteem, perpetuate transgenerational cycles of abuse, and result in adverse mental health outcomes like an increased likelihood of developing depression and/or bipolar disorder.[9][8][5][1]

Staying in abusive relationships[edit]
Owing to the debilitating psychological manipulation involved in the development of a trauma bond, abused people tend to stay in abusive relationships, mainly because the perceived consequences of leaving the relationship seem far more negative than the consequences of staying in the abusive relationship.[6][2]
In such relationships, maltreatment is often interspersed with fragments of solace and peace that involve the expression of love, kindness, affection, and/or general friendliness from the abuser towards the abused.[6] This intermittent reinforcement of a reward (here, the abuser's love and kindness) amidst all the abuse becomes what the victim begins to hold on to. Thus, victims tend to become emotionally dependent on the abuser and construct the belief that their survival is contingent upon receiving the abuser's love.[6] Victims thereby begin to formulate their sense of identity (a form of self) around receiving the abuser's affection, which points to what could be gaslighting. Kindness and affection from the abuser amidst the abuse become a focal point for the victim's emotional dependence. This dependency is characterized by the belief that their survival is contingent on the abuser's love and affection, leading victims to construct their sense of identity and self-worth around this dynamic.[29] Additionally, the provision of intermittent love and affection makes the victim cling to the hope that things can change.[11] Furthermore, self-blame, the fear of social stigma and embarrassment, the fear of loneliness in the absence of a partner, and the lack of or poor social support from other family and friends also contribute to individuals remaining in abusive relationships.[11]

Perpetuation of transgenerational cycles of abuse[edit]
People who have experienced trauma and traumatic bonds can, knowingly or unknowingly, repeat the cycle of abuse. In other words, victims who were traumatically bonded with abusers may grow to become abusers themselves. The abuse that victims inflict may or may not involve trauma bonding.[9]
For instance, in a 2018 study on convicted child murderers, researchers found that caregivers who committed child homicide (murdered their child or care receiver) had experienced traumatic experiences and had trauma bonds with abusers in their early lives.[8] Individuals with cruel and/or dismissive caregivers are likely to develop insecure attachments that result in a host of problems, including emotion deregulation and an attitude of confusion towards the caregiver, who becomes a source of comfort as well as fear. These adverse attachments can manifest in an individual's relationship with their own children as well. Attachment issues and painful memories of trauma bonds with their own caregivers can be triggered, and individuals may demonstrate heightened and disproportionate aggression toward their child, some culminating in homicide.[8] In this study, participants experienced physical abuse, sexual abuse, a lack of protection from external dangers, abandonment, emotional rejection, and more from their caregivers. Nonetheless, participants expressed unconditional love towards their caregivers, justified by wanting to maintain an overall positive view of them.[8] In their continued efforts to form an emotional connection, a trauma bond was fostered. These experiences had a severe negative impact on their relationship and bonding with their own children, contributing to "affectionless, unempathetic interpersonal behavior" that inflated aggressive and violent tendencies triggered by vulnerabilities.[8]

Neurophysiological outcomes[edit]
The experience of being in a trauma bond can have adverse neurological and neurophysiological outcomes. The body of the victim of a trauma bond is in a perpetual 'fight-or-flight' response state, which can increase cortisol levels that can have a cascading effect and trigger other hormones. 
Persistent, chronic stress can also hamper the cellular response in the body, thereby negatively impacting immunity, organ health, mood, energy levels, and more.[1] In the long run, this can cause epigenetic changes as well. Furthermore, a study conducted in 2015 found that establishing a trauma bond in infancy is also linked with amygdala dysfunction, neurobehavioral deficits, and increased vulnerability to psychiatric disorders later on in life.[30] Psychological abuse is correlated with sleep-related impairments. Disruption in sleep patterns leads to adverse neurophysiological problems, such as an increase in anxiety and irritability. For victims of psychological abuse, the increase in cortisol affects the brain in such a manner that it allows the trauma bonding to be strengthened.[31]

Adverse mental health outcomes[edit]
Trauma bonding is linked to several adverse mental health and well-being outcomes. Due to the abuse and the emotional dependence on their abusers, victims tend to develop an incredibly negative self-image. "Controlling, restricting, degrading, isolating, or dominating" abuse has a crippling effect on the self-image and self-esteem of the abused, and this psychological abuse is far more dangerous than physical abuse.[5] In a 2010 study on battered women labeling themselves as "stupid", researchers found that victims who felt like they allowed themselves to be mistreated and victims who stayed in abusive relationships labeled themselves as "stupid" for doing so.[10] This further contributes to a negative self-image and the maintenance of low self-esteem, both of which foster a poor self-concept, which, in turn, adversely impacts mental well-being. The same was observed in the case study mentioned previously on grooming.[25]
Trauma bonding can also lead to dissociative symptoms that could be a self-preservation and/or coping mechanism. Neurobiological changes can also affect brain development and hamper learning. The internalization of psychological manipulation and trauma can cause anxiety and increase the likelihood of engaging in risk-taking behaviors.[1] Furthermore, the isolation involved in trauma bonding can foster a generally skewed sense of trust, making victims vulnerable to situations that may retraumatize or revictimize them. Victims may also tend to either completely dismiss or minimize dangerous, damaging behaviors and violence around them.[1]
Trauma bonds in parent-child relationships (wherein the child is the victim and the parent is the abuser) can also lead to depressive symptoms later in life.[9] In a 2017 study exploring this, it was found that an "affectionless control" parenting style, characterized by high protection and low care from parents, was a major predictor of depressive symptomology for the victim. In other words, the presence of poor parental bonding coupled with childhood trauma bonds increased the likelihood of the child developing depressive symptoms in the future. A negative self-image is formed when feelings of inadequacy and hopelessness persist and are reinforced by caregivers. Perpetual efforts to seek secure emotional attachments reap no rewards, and a trauma bond facilitates a negative core schema that influences perceptions and interactions throughout one's life.[9] This can give rise to mental health issues such as depression, bipolar disorder, mania, suicidality, and substance abuse that can be pervasive and lifelong.

022. Furthermore, research shows that the memory of instances wherein abuse was experienced is dissociated or state-dependent, meaning that the memories of abuse only fully resurface when the situation is similar in intensity and experience to the original situation of terror.[19]此外，研究表明，遭受虐待的记忆是分离的或依赖于状态的，这意味着只有当情况的强度和经历与最初的恐怖情况相似时，虐待的记忆才会完全重新出现。[19]
If and when the victim finally decides to leave the abusive relationship, the immediate relief from the traumatizing violence will begin to abate, and the underlying, deep attachment formed from intermittent reinforcement will begin to surface. This current period of vulnerability and emotional exhaustion will likely trigger memories of when the abuser was temporarily affectionate and caring. In the desire to receive that affection once more, the victim may try to return to the abusive relationship.[12][2]如果受害者最终决定离开虐待关系，那么从创伤性暴力中得到的直接缓解将开始减弱，而间歇性强化形成的潜在的、深层的依恋将开始浮出水面。当前的脆弱和情绪疲惫的时期可能会引发施虐者暂时深情和关怀的记忆。为了再次获得这种感情，受害者可能会试图回到虐待关系中。[12][2]
Strong social support, however, can be a protective factor in preserving the victim's functioning and providing a buffer in traumatic situations.[20]然而，强有力的社会支持可以成为保护受害者功能并在创伤情况下提供缓冲的保护因素。[20]

The role of attachment  依恋的作用[edit]
John Bowlby maintained that secure attachment was an evolutionary human need that superseded even the need for food and reproduction.[2] Attachment has been explored in depth in caregiver-child dynamics, but recent research has shown that the principles that explain attachment between caregivers and infants can also explain attachment throughout one's life span, specifically in the context of intimate relationships and romantic bonds.[21]约翰·鲍尔比坚持认为，安全依恋是人类进化的一种需求，甚至取代了对食物和繁殖的需求。[2] 依恋在照顾者与儿童的动态中得到了深入的探讨，但最近的研究表明，解释照顾者和婴儿之间依恋的原则也可以解释一个人一生中的依恋，特别是在亲密关系和浪漫纽带的背景下。[21]
Attachment bonds formed during early life lay the foundation for interpersonal relationships, interactions, personality characteristics, and mental health in the future.[22] Infants usually form attachments with their parents or immediate caregivers. Harlow's research on monkeys shows that infant monkeys form attachment bonds even with abusive mothers (in the experimental setup, the abusive 'mother' was a monkey made out of fabric who delivered mild shocks to the infant monkey or flung the infant monkey across the arena). 
早年形成的依恋纽带为未来的人际关系、互动、性格特征和心理健康奠定了基础。[22] 婴儿通常与父母或直接照顾者形成依恋。 哈洛对猴子的研究表明，即使与虐待的母亲，幼猴也会形成依恋纽带（在实验设置中，虐待的“母亲”是一只由织物制成的猴子，它对幼猴进行轻微的电击或将幼猴扔过竞技场）。These findings also apply to human attachment bonds. Even in situations where immediate caregivers are abusive, human infants still tend to attach to them; rejection from a caregiver only enhances the efforts to increase proximity to them and establish an attachment bond with them.[19]
Furthermore, in situations of danger, humans seek increased attachment. When ordinary pathways of attachment are unavailable, people tend to turn to their abusers. This leads to strong bonds and deep emotional connections with abusers. This attachment—both to abusive caregivers and to other abusers in the absence of a main caregiver—may be adaptive in the short run as it may aid survival. But in the long run, this attachment is maladaptive and can lay the foundation for, increase vulnerability to, and even directly lead to trauma bonding.

Stockholm syndrome[edit]
The concept of trauma bonding is often conflated with Stockholm syndrome. Although there are overarching similarities between the two, especially in the context of developing an emotional bond with one's abuser, trauma bonding and Stockholm syndrome are distinct from one another. The main difference is the direction of the relationship.[1]
In other words, in the case of Stockholm syndrome, the emotional connection is reciprocal, such that the abuser also appears to develop an emotional connection towards the abused and harbor positive feelings for the abused, in addition to the abused developing an emotional bond with the abuser.[1]

Realms of existence[edit]

In abusive relationships[edit]


Although the victim may disclose the abuse, the trauma bond means that the victim may wish to receive comfort from the very person who abused them.


PACE UK[23]
Unhealthy, or traumatic, bonding occurs between people in an abusive relationship. The bond is stronger for people who have grown up in abusive households and who believe abuse to be a normal part of relationships.[13] On the psychometric scale for Stockholm syndrome, the three main components are: justifying an abuser through cognitive distortions, damage, ongoing psychological effects of abuse, and love.[6]
Initially, the abuser is inconsistent in approach, increasing in intensity over time. As the bond progresses, it may become more difficult for victims to leave abusers with whom they have bonded.[13]
Fear, children, and financial constraints may be factors preventing victims from leaving abusive relationships.[24]

Battered women[edit]
Initial research about battered women held the view that a victim's return to an abusive relationship was an indicator of a flawed personality and, more specifically, masochism.[12] However, this view was perpetuated by the 'just-world fallacy', the cognitive bias towards the idea that people "get what is coming for them". The tendency to victim-blame arises from the belief that the world is a just and fair place where the victim is seen as deserving of any negative consequences. However, research on battered women and research on traumatic bonding have shown that that is not the case. In terms of battered women's decision to stay in or return to an abusive relationship, many factors are at play, ranging from family history and role expectations to access to resources to the dynamics of the relationship itself.[12] A crucial part of the relationship's dynamic is the existence of a trauma bond. Maltreatment interspersed with periods of kindness aids in the formation of a trauma bond that makes the victim harbor positive feelings towards the abuser.[12]
Among battered women, a three-phase process can explain the intermittent reward-punishment cycle. During phase one, there is a gradual increase in tension, followed by an "explosive battering incident" in phase two, which is then followed by a peaceful expression of love and affection from the abuser during phase three. These phases' recurring and cyclical nature gives rise to a trauma bond.[2]

Sex trafficking[edit]
Trauma bonds are extremely common in situations of sex trafficking, child grooming, commercial sexual exploitation of children (CSEC), and pimp-prostitute relationships.

Grooming[edit]
Child grooming involves establishing and maintaining trauma bonds between the child and the abuser. Along with the factors of power imbalance and intermittent reinforcement that contribute to trauma bonding, child grooming also necessitates gaining the trust of those around the child. Grooming also involves gaining the child's trust while simultaneously violating their boundaries. Treats and trips are used as bribes to both gain access to the child as well as ensure that they comply.[25] Intense attachments coupled with cognitive distortions deepen the bond.
A 2019 case study explores the life of one individual who was groomed. The victim's perception of the abuser as a benefactor, a substitute parent, and a mind controller all contributed to the development of a traumatic bond between the victim and the abuser.[25] In terms of being a benefactor, the abuser in this case study went above and beyond to give the victim what they needed. From getting the victim a job to gifting them a plot of land for their first house, the abuser was always present as a benefactor. The abuser also acted as a substitute parent, advising and offering emotional support in times of crisis. The roles of the abuser as a benefactor and substitute parent constituted the good treatment necessary to establish a trauma bond. In contrast, the abuser's role as a mind controller involved controlling and dominating tendencies that emulated being brainwashed.[25] This combination of perceptions established a traumatic bond that the victim found incredibly difficult to break because rejecting the emotional connection as a whole would also involve rejecting the perks and benefits—the trips, the gifts, the treats, the confidante, and the caretaker.
Child grooming can be understood from a developmental perspective as well, and the relationship between the victim and the abuser evolves across the lifespan. Grooming starts when the child is extremely young—the trust of the child and the family is acquired. The child is given immense attention and is showered with gifts.[25] As the individual matures and enters adolescence, the abuser becomes a confidante and a benefactor. In the case study mentioned previously, the abuser gave the victim career advice, picked him up, and dropped him off at school. Then, at the onset of adulthood, the abuser provided the victim with land to build their home and became the person the victim brought their partner home to. As the victim's developmental needs evolved, so did the abuser's response, such that the only thing constant was the victim's need for affection. In other words, the abuser was "able to capitalize on [the victim's] relational needs" until the victim was able to meet those needs in other ways.[25]

Commercial sexual exploitation of children (CSEC)[edit]
The commercial sexual exploitation of children (CSEC) can cause debilitating physical and psychological trauma. Along with causing functional impairments, it can amplify risk-taking behaviors and increase impulse dysregulation, further compromising the child's ability to conceptualize, comprehend, establish, and maintain boundaries. This can lead to confusion regarding what safety, affection, intimacy, and kindness entail, resulting in the formation of a trauma bond with the abuser or trafficker that is based on skewed perceptions of safety and kindness.[1] The trauma bond deepens and strengthens when isolation and threats to survival increase, forcing the victim to depend almost entirely on the abuser for survival and protection. This increased emotional dependence on the abuser normalizes the emotional violence experienced by the victim at the hands of the abuser, and gradually, the victim develops a sense of trust and safety, albeit skewed, towards the abuser.[1]

Trauma-coercive bond[edit]
Trauma bonding thrives in the presence of a power imbalance and intermittent reward/punishment behavior. Trauma-coercive bonding, on the other hand, has two additional elements: social isolation and the perceived inability to escape the situation. Since these two elements are crucial to the experiences of victims of CSEC, their bonds with their abusers are better described as trauma-coercive bonds rather than simply as trauma bonds. The element of coercion concreted by social isolation and the perceived inability to escape makes the trauma bond more complex and far more deeply rooted.[1] The use of coercive trauma bonding encapsulates the psycho-social dynamics of a relationship between a victim and a perpetrator of CSEC.

Intimate partner violence (IPV)[edit]
IPV has been defined as physical, sexual, psychological, economic, or stalking abuse, both concrete and menaced, perpetuated by current or ex-partners. Trauma bonding is used to solidify this type of relationship by rationalizing and/or minimizing a violent partner's behavior, self-blame, and reporting love in the context of fear.

Parent-child relationships[edit]
Trauma bonds in parent-child or caregiver-child dynamics can be borne from abuse, neglect, or incestuous relationships.[26]

Abuse and/or neglect[edit]
Children of dismissive caregivers or cruel caregivers can develop insecure attachments, which can be very dysfunctional. Inconsistencies in reward and punishment (i.e., intermittent reinforcement of good and bad treatment) can highlight the affection the child receives from the parent, forcing a split between the abuse and the kindness such that the child seeks to form an overall positive view of the caregiver and thus focuses only on the affection and kindness they receive.[15][8] Overall, a trauma bond develops such that the child's sense of self is derived from their emotional dependence on the authority figure, who, in this case, is the parent and/or caregiver.

Incest[edit]
Incestuous relationships between parents and children cultivate trauma bonds similar to those prevalent in victims of sex trafficking. All participants in a 1994 study by Jane Kay Hedberg on trauma in adult incest survivors demonstrated some trauma bonding with their abusers.[27] There was a positive correlation between the pervasiveness of the trauma bond and the amount of contact the victim or the victim's close family members had with the abuser: those who self-reported less pervasive trauma also reported sustained contact with their abuser, while those who self-reported more pervasive trauma demonstrated an active avoidance of maintaining a relationship with their abuser. In incestuous parent-child dynamics, the study found that maintaining an unhealthy relationship with the abuser contributes to trauma and sustains the trauma bond.[27] However, Hedberg cautions against generalizing findings from the study since the sample was small (n = 11) and wasn't representative of the general population of incest survivors.[footnote 1]
This aligns with the idea that trauma bonds are toxic and difficult to leave due to the inherent power imbalance, which, in parent-child relationships, is even more pervasive than in other situations. Incestuous relationships also have an added layer of betrayal trauma, which arises from the exploitation of the victim's trust, resulting in a feeling of betrayal.[22]

Military (tours of duty)[edit]
Trauma bonds can develop in military settings. The literature demonstrates this specifically in the context of tours of duty, wherein military personnel are deployed in hostile environments or areas of combat. A 2019 study exploring this specific phenomenon sought to understand the traumatic bond developed between Japanese soldiers and Korean 'comfort women' in the midst of World War II.[28] The trauma, in this case, was two-fold: not only did the trauma bond develop in an abused-abuser dynamic, but the trauma itself was also a result of and was perpetuated by the war. While the relationships provided the Japanese soldiers with emotional relief and an escape from the violence of the war and the tyranny of the higher-ranking officers, they also provided the Korean 'comfort women' with much-desired protection and kindness from the soldiers.[28]
Soldiers would behave aggressively and violently towards the 'comfort women' and often sexually exploit them. They would use intimidation tactics to assert dominance and foster coercion. However, this abuse would be interspersed with kindness and empathy from the soldiers, whose moods and subsequent behavior and interactions were highly contingent on the time and context of the ongoing war.[28] Nonetheless, the intermittent kindness allowed the formation and maintenance of a trauma bond. Intermittent rewards were sometimes also more tangible, in the form of food, outings, and physical protection. However, protection and emotional support were pivotal in maintaining the trauma bonds and far more important than food and outings. The Korean 'comfort women' eventually came to be emotionally dependent on the Japanese soldiers and began to relate this dependence with their own sense of power, thereby establishing a trauma bond that, for some, persisted even after the war was over.[28]

Outcomes[edit]
Trauma bonding has several short-term and long-term impacts on the abused. It can force people to stay in abusive relationships, negatively affect self-image and self-esteem, perpetuate transgenerational cycles of abuse, and result in adverse mental health outcomes like an increased likelihood of developing depression and/or bipolar disorder.[9][8][5][1]

Staying in abusive relationships[edit]
Owing to the debilitating psychological manipulation involved in the development of a trauma bond, abused people tend to stay in abusive relationships, mainly because the perceived consequences of leaving the relationship seem far more negative than the consequences of staying in the abusive relationship.[6][2]
In such relationships, maltreatment is often interspersed with fragments of solace and peace that involve the expression of love, kindness, affection, and/or general friendliness from the abuser towards the abused.[6] This intermittent reinforcement of a reward (here, the abuser's love and kindness) amidst all the abuse becomes what the victim begins to hold on to. Thus, victims tend to become emotionally dependent on the abuser and construct the belief that their survival is contingent upon receiving the abuser's love.[6] Victims thereby begin to formulate their sense of identity (a form of self) around receiving the abuser's affection, which points to what could be gaslighting. Kindness and affection from the abuser amidst the abuse become a focal point for the victim's emotional dependence. This dependency is characterized by the belief that their survival is contingent on the abuser's love and affection, leading victims to construct their sense of identity and self-worth around this dynamic.[29] Additionally, the provision of intermittent love and affection makes the victim cling to the hope that things can change.[11] Furthermore, self-blame, the fear of social stigma and embarrassment, the fear of loneliness in the absence of a partner, and the lack of or poor social support from other family and friends also contribute to individuals remaining in abusive relationships.[11]

Perpetuation of transgenerational cycles of abuse[edit]
People who have experienced trauma and traumatic bonds can, knowingly or unknowingly, repeat the cycle of abuse. In other words, victims who were traumatically bonded with abusers may grow to become abusers themselves. The abuse that victims inflict may or may not involve trauma bonding.[9]
For instance, in a 2018 study on convicted child murderers, researchers found that caregivers who committed child homicide (murdered their child or care receiver) had experienced traumatic experiences and had trauma bonds with abusers in their early lives.[8] Individuals with cruel and/or dismissive caregivers are likely to develop insecure attachments that result in a host of problems, including emotion deregulation and an attitude of confusion towards the caregiver, who becomes a source of comfort as well as fear. These adverse attachments can manifest in an individual's relationship with their own children as well. Attachment issues and painful memories of trauma bonds with their own caregivers can be triggered, and individuals may demonstrate heightened and disproportionate aggression toward their child, some culminating in homicide.[8] In this study, participants experienced physical abuse, sexual abuse, a lack of protection from external dangers, abandonment, emotional rejection, and more from their caregivers. Nonetheless, participants expressed unconditional love towards their caregivers, justified by wanting to maintain an overall positive view of them.[8] In their continued efforts to form an emotional connection, a trauma bond was fostered. These experiences had a severe negative impact on their relationship and bonding with their own children, contributing to "affectionless, unempathetic interpersonal behavior" that inflated aggressive and violent tendencies triggered by vulnerabilities.[8]

Neurophysiological outcomes[edit]
The experience of being in a trauma bond can have adverse neurological and neurophysiological outcomes. The body of the victim of a trauma bond is in a perpetual 'fight-or-flight' response state, which can increase cortisol levels that can have a cascading effect and trigger other hormones. 
Persistent, chronic stress can also hamper the cellular response in the body, thereby negatively impacting immunity, organ health, mood, energy levels, and more.[1] In the long run, this can cause epigenetic changes as well. Furthermore, a study conducted in 2015 found that establishing a trauma bond in infancy is also linked with amygdala dysfunction, neurobehavioral deficits, and increased vulnerability to psychiatric disorders later on in life.[30] Psychological abuse is correlated with sleep-related impairments. Disruption in sleep patterns leads to adverse neurophysiological problems, such as an increase in anxiety and irritability. For victims of psychological abuse, the increase in cortisol affects the brain in such a manner that it allows the trauma bonding to be strengthened.[31]

Adverse mental health outcomes[edit]
Trauma bonding is linked to several adverse mental health and well-being outcomes. Due to the abuse and the emotional dependence on their abusers, victims tend to develop an incredibly negative self-image. "Controlling, restricting, degrading, isolating, or dominating" abuse has a crippling effect on the self-image and self-esteem of the abused, and this psychological abuse is far more dangerous than physical abuse.[5] In a 2010 study on battered women labeling themselves as "stupid", researchers found that victims who felt like they allowed themselves to be mistreated and victims who stayed in abusive relationships labeled themselves as "stupid" for doing so.[10] This further contributes to a negative self-image and the maintenance of low self-esteem, both of which foster a poor self-concept, which, in turn, adversely impacts mental well-being. The same was observed in the case study mentioned previously on grooming.[25]
Trauma bonding can also lead to dissociative symptoms that could be a self-preservation and/or coping mechanism. Neurobiological changes can also affect brain development and hamper learning. The internalization of psychological manipulation and trauma can cause anxiety and increase the likelihood of engaging in risk-taking behaviors.[1] Furthermore, the isolation involved in trauma bonding can foster a generally skewed sense of trust, making victims vulnerable to situations that may retraumatize or revictimize them. Victims may also tend to either completely dismiss or minimize dangerous, damaging behaviors and violence around them.[1]
Trauma bonds in parent-child relationships (wherein the child is the victim and the parent is the abuser) can also lead to depressive symptoms later in life.[9] In a 2017 study exploring this, it was found that an "affectionless control" parenting style, characterized by high protection and low care from parents, was a major predictor of depressive symptomology for the victim. In other words, the presence of poor parental bonding coupled with childhood trauma bonds increased the likelihood of the child developing depressive symptoms in the future. A negative self-image is formed when feelings of inadequacy and hopelessness persist and are reinforced by caregivers. Perpetual efforts to seek secure emotional attachments reap no rewards, and a trauma bond facilitates a negative core schema that influences perceptions and interactions throughout one's life.[9] This can give rise to mental health issues such as depression, bipolar disorder, mania, suicidality, and substance abuse that can be pervasive and lifelong.

023. If and when the victim finally decides to leave the abusive relationship, the immediate relief from the traumatizing violence will begin to abate, and the underlying, deep attachment formed from intermittent reinforcement will begin to surface. This current period of vulnerability and emotional exhaustion will likely trigger memories of when the abuser was temporarily affectionate and caring. In the desire to receive that affection once more, the victim may try to return to the abusive relationship.[12][2]如果受害者最终决定离开虐待关系，那么从创伤性暴力中得到的直接缓解将开始减弱，而间歇性强化形成的潜在的、深层的依恋将开始浮出水面。当前的脆弱和情绪疲惫的时期可能会引发施虐者暂时深情和关怀的记忆。为了再次获得这种感情，受害者可能会试图回到虐待关系中。[12][2]
Strong social support, however, can be a protective factor in preserving the victim's functioning and providing a buffer in traumatic situations.[20]然而，强有力的社会支持可以成为保护受害者功能并在创伤情况下提供缓冲的保护因素。[20]

The role of attachment  依恋的作用[edit]
John Bowlby maintained that secure attachment was an evolutionary human need that superseded even the need for food and reproduction.[2] Attachment has been explored in depth in caregiver-child dynamics, but recent research has shown that the principles that explain attachment between caregivers and infants can also explain attachment throughout one's life span, specifically in the context of intimate relationships and romantic bonds.[21]约翰·鲍尔比坚持认为，安全依恋是人类进化的一种需求，甚至取代了对食物和繁殖的需求。[2] 依恋在照顾者与儿童的动态中得到了深入的探讨，但最近的研究表明，解释照顾者和婴儿之间依恋的原则也可以解释一个人一生中的依恋，特别是在亲密关系和浪漫纽带的背景下。[21]
Attachment bonds formed during early life lay the foundation for interpersonal relationships, interactions, personality characteristics, and mental health in the future.[22] Infants usually form attachments with their parents or immediate caregivers. Harlow's research on monkeys shows that infant monkeys form attachment bonds even with abusive mothers (in the experimental setup, the abusive 'mother' was a monkey made out of fabric who delivered mild shocks to the infant monkey or flung the infant monkey across the arena). 
早年形成的依恋纽带为未来的人际关系、互动、性格特征和心理健康奠定了基础。[22] 婴儿通常与父母或直接照顾者形成依恋。 哈洛对猴子的研究表明，即使与虐待的母亲，幼猴也会形成依恋纽带（在实验设置中，虐待的“母亲”是一只由织物制成的猴子，它对幼猴进行轻微的电击或将幼猴扔过竞技场）。These findings also apply to human attachment bonds. Even in situations where immediate caregivers are abusive, human infants still tend to attach to them; rejection from a caregiver only enhances the efforts to increase proximity to them and establish an attachment bond with them.[19]
Furthermore, in situations of danger, humans seek increased attachment. When ordinary pathways of attachment are unavailable, people tend to turn to their abusers. This leads to strong bonds and deep emotional connections with abusers. This attachment—both to abusive caregivers and to other abusers in the absence of a main caregiver—may be adaptive in the short run as it may aid survival. But in the long run, this attachment is maladaptive and can lay the foundation for, increase vulnerability to, and even directly lead to trauma bonding.

Stockholm syndrome[edit]
The concept of trauma bonding is often conflated with Stockholm syndrome. Although there are overarching similarities between the two, especially in the context of developing an emotional bond with one's abuser, trauma bonding and Stockholm syndrome are distinct from one another. The main difference is the direction of the relationship.[1]
In other words, in the case of Stockholm syndrome, the emotional connection is reciprocal, such that the abuser also appears to develop an emotional connection towards the abused and harbor positive feelings for the abused, in addition to the abused developing an emotional bond with the abuser.[1]

Realms of existence[edit]

In abusive relationships[edit]


Although the victim may disclose the abuse, the trauma bond means that the victim may wish to receive comfort from the very person who abused them.


PACE UK[23]
Unhealthy, or traumatic, bonding occurs between people in an abusive relationship. The bond is stronger for people who have grown up in abusive households and who believe abuse to be a normal part of relationships.[13] On the psychometric scale for Stockholm syndrome, the three main components are: justifying an abuser through cognitive distortions, damage, ongoing psychological effects of abuse, and love.[6]
Initially, the abuser is inconsistent in approach, increasing in intensity over time. As the bond progresses, it may become more difficult for victims to leave abusers with whom they have bonded.[13]
Fear, children, and financial constraints may be factors preventing victims from leaving abusive relationships.[24]

Battered women[edit]
Initial research about battered women held the view that a victim's return to an abusive relationship was an indicator of a flawed personality and, more specifically, masochism.[12] However, this view was perpetuated by the 'just-world fallacy', the cognitive bias towards the idea that people "get what is coming for them". The tendency to victim-blame arises from the belief that the world is a just and fair place where the victim is seen as deserving of any negative consequences. However, research on battered women and research on traumatic bonding have shown that that is not the case. In terms of battered women's decision to stay in or return to an abusive relationship, many factors are at play, ranging from family history and role expectations to access to resources to the dynamics of the relationship itself.[12] A crucial part of the relationship's dynamic is the existence of a trauma bond. Maltreatment interspersed with periods of kindness aids in the formation of a trauma bond that makes the victim harbor positive feelings towards the abuser.[12]
Among battered women, a three-phase process can explain the intermittent reward-punishment cycle. During phase one, there is a gradual increase in tension, followed by an "explosive battering incident" in phase two, which is then followed by a peaceful expression of love and affection from the abuser during phase three. These phases' recurring and cyclical nature gives rise to a trauma bond.[2]

Sex trafficking[edit]
Trauma bonds are extremely common in situations of sex trafficking, child grooming, commercial sexual exploitation of children (CSEC), and pimp-prostitute relationships.

Grooming[edit]
Child grooming involves establishing and maintaining trauma bonds between the child and the abuser. Along with the factors of power imbalance and intermittent reinforcement that contribute to trauma bonding, child grooming also necessitates gaining the trust of those around the child. Grooming also involves gaining the child's trust while simultaneously violating their boundaries. Treats and trips are used as bribes to both gain access to the child as well as ensure that they comply.[25] Intense attachments coupled with cognitive distortions deepen the bond.
A 2019 case study explores the life of one individual who was groomed. The victim's perception of the abuser as a benefactor, a substitute parent, and a mind controller all contributed to the development of a traumatic bond between the victim and the abuser.[25] In terms of being a benefactor, the abuser in this case study went above and beyond to give the victim what they needed. From getting the victim a job to gifting them a plot of land for their first house, the abuser was always present as a benefactor. The abuser also acted as a substitute parent, advising and offering emotional support in times of crisis. The roles of the abuser as a benefactor and substitute parent constituted the good treatment necessary to establish a trauma bond. In contrast, the abuser's role as a mind controller involved controlling and dominating tendencies that emulated being brainwashed.[25] This combination of perceptions established a traumatic bond that the victim found incredibly difficult to break because rejecting the emotional connection as a whole would also involve rejecting the perks and benefits—the trips, the gifts, the treats, the confidante, and the caretaker.
Child grooming can be understood from a developmental perspective as well, and the relationship between the victim and the abuser evolves across the lifespan. Grooming starts when the child is extremely young—the trust of the child and the family is acquired. The child is given immense attention and is showered with gifts.[25] As the individual matures and enters adolescence, the abuser becomes a confidante and a benefactor. In the case study mentioned previously, the abuser gave the victim career advice, picked him up, and dropped him off at school. Then, at the onset of adulthood, the abuser provided the victim with land to build their home and became the person the victim brought their partner home to. As the victim's developmental needs evolved, so did the abuser's response, such that the only thing constant was the victim's need for affection. In other words, the abuser was "able to capitalize on [the victim's] relational needs" until the victim was able to meet those needs in other ways.[25]

Commercial sexual exploitation of children (CSEC)[edit]
The commercial sexual exploitation of children (CSEC) can cause debilitating physical and psychological trauma. Along with causing functional impairments, it can amplify risk-taking behaviors and increase impulse dysregulation, further compromising the child's ability to conceptualize, comprehend, establish, and maintain boundaries. This can lead to confusion regarding what safety, affection, intimacy, and kindness entail, resulting in the formation of a trauma bond with the abuser or trafficker that is based on skewed perceptions of safety and kindness.[1] The trauma bond deepens and strengthens when isolation and threats to survival increase, forcing the victim to depend almost entirely on the abuser for survival and protection. This increased emotional dependence on the abuser normalizes the emotional violence experienced by the victim at the hands of the abuser, and gradually, the victim develops a sense of trust and safety, albeit skewed, towards the abuser.[1]

Trauma-coercive bond[edit]
Trauma bonding thrives in the presence of a power imbalance and intermittent reward/punishment behavior. Trauma-coercive bonding, on the other hand, has two additional elements: social isolation and the perceived inability to escape the situation. Since these two elements are crucial to the experiences of victims of CSEC, their bonds with their abusers are better described as trauma-coercive bonds rather than simply as trauma bonds. The element of coercion concreted by social isolation and the perceived inability to escape makes the trauma bond more complex and far more deeply rooted.[1] The use of coercive trauma bonding encapsulates the psycho-social dynamics of a relationship between a victim and a perpetrator of CSEC.

Intimate partner violence (IPV)[edit]
IPV has been defined as physical, sexual, psychological, economic, or stalking abuse, both concrete and menaced, perpetuated by current or ex-partners. Trauma bonding is used to solidify this type of relationship by rationalizing and/or minimizing a violent partner's behavior, self-blame, and reporting love in the context of fear.

Parent-child relationships[edit]
Trauma bonds in parent-child or caregiver-child dynamics can be borne from abuse, neglect, or incestuous relationships.[26]

Abuse and/or neglect[edit]
Children of dismissive caregivers or cruel caregivers can develop insecure attachments, which can be very dysfunctional. Inconsistencies in reward and punishment (i.e., intermittent reinforcement of good and bad treatment) can highlight the affection the child receives from the parent, forcing a split between the abuse and the kindness such that the child seeks to form an overall positive view of the caregiver and thus focuses only on the affection and kindness they receive.[15][8] Overall, a trauma bond develops such that the child's sense of self is derived from their emotional dependence on the authority figure, who, in this case, is the parent and/or caregiver.

Incest[edit]
Incestuous relationships between parents and children cultivate trauma bonds similar to those prevalent in victims of sex trafficking. All participants in a 1994 study by Jane Kay Hedberg on trauma in adult incest survivors demonstrated some trauma bonding with their abusers.[27] There was a positive correlation between the pervasiveness of the trauma bond and the amount of contact the victim or the victim's close family members had with the abuser: those who self-reported less pervasive trauma also reported sustained contact with their abuser, while those who self-reported more pervasive trauma demonstrated an active avoidance of maintaining a relationship with their abuser. In incestuous parent-child dynamics, the study found that maintaining an unhealthy relationship with the abuser contributes to trauma and sustains the trauma bond.[27] However, Hedberg cautions against generalizing findings from the study since the sample was small (n = 11) and wasn't representative of the general population of incest survivors.[footnote 1]
This aligns with the idea that trauma bonds are toxic and difficult to leave due to the inherent power imbalance, which, in parent-child relationships, is even more pervasive than in other situations. Incestuous relationships also have an added layer of betrayal trauma, which arises from the exploitation of the victim's trust, resulting in a feeling of betrayal.[22]

Military (tours of duty)[edit]
Trauma bonds can develop in military settings. The literature demonstrates this specifically in the context of tours of duty, wherein military personnel are deployed in hostile environments or areas of combat. A 2019 study exploring this specific phenomenon sought to understand the traumatic bond developed between Japanese soldiers and Korean 'comfort women' in the midst of World War II.[28] The trauma, in this case, was two-fold: not only did the trauma bond develop in an abused-abuser dynamic, but the trauma itself was also a result of and was perpetuated by the war. While the relationships provided the Japanese soldiers with emotional relief and an escape from the violence of the war and the tyranny of the higher-ranking officers, they also provided the Korean 'comfort women' with much-desired protection and kindness from the soldiers.[28]
Soldiers would behave aggressively and violently towards the 'comfort women' and often sexually exploit them. They would use intimidation tactics to assert dominance and foster coercion. However, this abuse would be interspersed with kindness and empathy from the soldiers, whose moods and subsequent behavior and interactions were highly contingent on the time and context of the ongoing war.[28] Nonetheless, the intermittent kindness allowed the formation and maintenance of a trauma bond. Intermittent rewards were sometimes also more tangible, in the form of food, outings, and physical protection. However, protection and emotional support were pivotal in maintaining the trauma bonds and far more important than food and outings. The Korean 'comfort women' eventually came to be emotionally dependent on the Japanese soldiers and began to relate this dependence with their own sense of power, thereby establishing a trauma bond that, for some, persisted even after the war was over.[28]

Outcomes[edit]
Trauma bonding has several short-term and long-term impacts on the abused. It can force people to stay in abusive relationships, negatively affect self-image and self-esteem, perpetuate transgenerational cycles of abuse, and result in adverse mental health outcomes like an increased likelihood of developing depression and/or bipolar disorder.[9][8][5][1]

Staying in abusive relationships[edit]
Owing to the debilitating psychological manipulation involved in the development of a trauma bond, abused people tend to stay in abusive relationships, mainly because the perceived consequences of leaving the relationship seem far more negative than the consequences of staying in the abusive relationship.[6][2]
In such relationships, maltreatment is often interspersed with fragments of solace and peace that involve the expression of love, kindness, affection, and/or general friendliness from the abuser towards the abused.[6] This intermittent reinforcement of a reward (here, the abuser's love and kindness) amidst all the abuse becomes what the victim begins to hold on to. Thus, victims tend to become emotionally dependent on the abuser and construct the belief that their survival is contingent upon receiving the abuser's love.[6] Victims thereby begin to formulate their sense of identity (a form of self) around receiving the abuser's affection, which points to what could be gaslighting. Kindness and affection from the abuser amidst the abuse become a focal point for the victim's emotional dependence. This dependency is characterized by the belief that their survival is contingent on the abuser's love and affection, leading victims to construct their sense of identity and self-worth around this dynamic.[29] Additionally, the provision of intermittent love and affection makes the victim cling to the hope that things can change.[11] Furthermore, self-blame, the fear of social stigma and embarrassment, the fear of loneliness in the absence of a partner, and the lack of or poor social support from other family and friends also contribute to individuals remaining in abusive relationships.[11]

Perpetuation of transgenerational cycles of abuse[edit]
People who have experienced trauma and traumatic bonds can, knowingly or unknowingly, repeat the cycle of abuse. In other words, victims who were traumatically bonded with abusers may grow to become abusers themselves. The abuse that victims inflict may or may not involve trauma bonding.[9]
For instance, in a 2018 study on convicted child murderers, researchers found that caregivers who committed child homicide (murdered their child or care receiver) had experienced traumatic experiences and had trauma bonds with abusers in their early lives.[8] Individuals with cruel and/or dismissive caregivers are likely to develop insecure attachments that result in a host of problems, including emotion deregulation and an attitude of confusion towards the caregiver, who becomes a source of comfort as well as fear. These adverse attachments can manifest in an individual's relationship with their own children as well. Attachment issues and painful memories of trauma bonds with their own caregivers can be triggered, and individuals may demonstrate heightened and disproportionate aggression toward their child, some culminating in homicide.[8] In this study, participants experienced physical abuse, sexual abuse, a lack of protection from external dangers, abandonment, emotional rejection, and more from their caregivers. Nonetheless, participants expressed unconditional love towards their caregivers, justified by wanting to maintain an overall positive view of them.[8] In their continued efforts to form an emotional connection, a trauma bond was fostered. These experiences had a severe negative impact on their relationship and bonding with their own children, contributing to "affectionless, unempathetic interpersonal behavior" that inflated aggressive and violent tendencies triggered by vulnerabilities.[8]

Neurophysiological outcomes[edit]
The experience of being in a trauma bond can have adverse neurological and neurophysiological outcomes. The body of the victim of a trauma bond is in a perpetual 'fight-or-flight' response state, which can increase cortisol levels that can have a cascading effect and trigger other hormones. 
Persistent, chronic stress can also hamper the cellular response in the body, thereby negatively impacting immunity, organ health, mood, energy levels, and more.[1] In the long run, this can cause epigenetic changes as well. Furthermore, a study conducted in 2015 found that establishing a trauma bond in infancy is also linked with amygdala dysfunction, neurobehavioral deficits, and increased vulnerability to psychiatric disorders later on in life.[30] Psychological abuse is correlated with sleep-related impairments. Disruption in sleep patterns leads to adverse neurophysiological problems, such as an increase in anxiety and irritability. For victims of psychological abuse, the increase in cortisol affects the brain in such a manner that it allows the trauma bonding to be strengthened.[31]

Adverse mental health outcomes[edit]
Trauma bonding is linked to several adverse mental health and well-being outcomes. Due to the abuse and the emotional dependence on their abusers, victims tend to develop an incredibly negative self-image. "Controlling, restricting, degrading, isolating, or dominating" abuse has a crippling effect on the self-image and self-esteem of the abused, and this psychological abuse is far more dangerous than physical abuse.[5] In a 2010 study on battered women labeling themselves as "stupid", researchers found that victims who felt like they allowed themselves to be mistreated and victims who stayed in abusive relationships labeled themselves as "stupid" for doing so.[10] This further contributes to a negative self-image and the maintenance of low self-esteem, both of which foster a poor self-concept, which, in turn, adversely impacts mental well-being. The same was observed in the case study mentioned previously on grooming.[25]
Trauma bonding can also lead to dissociative symptoms that could be a self-preservation and/or coping mechanism. Neurobiological changes can also affect brain development and hamper learning. The internalization of psychological manipulation and trauma can cause anxiety and increase the likelihood of engaging in risk-taking behaviors.[1] Furthermore, the isolation involved in trauma bonding can foster a generally skewed sense of trust, making victims vulnerable to situations that may retraumatize or revictimize them. Victims may also tend to either completely dismiss or minimize dangerous, damaging behaviors and violence around them.[1]
Trauma bonds in parent-child relationships (wherein the child is the victim and the parent is the abuser) can also lead to depressive symptoms later in life.[9] In a 2017 study exploring this, it was found that an "affectionless control" parenting style, characterized by high protection and low care from parents, was a major predictor of depressive symptomology for the victim. In other words, the presence of poor parental bonding coupled with childhood trauma bonds increased the likelihood of the child developing depressive symptoms in the future. A negative self-image is formed when feelings of inadequacy and hopelessness persist and are reinforced by caregivers. Perpetual efforts to seek secure emotional attachments reap no rewards, and a trauma bond facilitates a negative core schema that influences perceptions and interactions throughout one's life.[9] This can give rise to mental health issues such as depression, bipolar disorder, mania, suicidality, and substance abuse that can be pervasive and lifelong.

024. Strong social support, however, can be a protective factor in preserving the victim's functioning and providing a buffer in traumatic situations.[20]然而，强有力的社会支持可以成为保护受害者功能并在创伤情况下提供缓冲的保护因素。[20]

025. The role of attachment  依恋的作用

026. John Bowlby maintained that secure attachment was an evolutionary human need that superseded even the need for food and reproduction.[2] Attachment has been explored in depth in caregiver-child dynamics, but recent research has shown that the principles that explain attachment between caregivers and infants can also explain attachment throughout one's life span, specifically in the context of intimate relationships and romantic bonds.[21]约翰·鲍尔比坚持认为，安全依恋是人类进化的一种需求，甚至取代了对食物和繁殖的需求。[2] 依恋在照顾者与儿童的动态中得到了深入的探讨，但最近的研究表明，解释照顾者和婴儿之间依恋的原则也可以解释一个人一生中的依恋，特别是在亲密关系和浪漫纽带的背景下。[21]
Attachment bonds formed during early life lay the foundation for interpersonal relationships, interactions, personality characteristics, and mental health in the future.[22] Infants usually form attachments with their parents or immediate caregivers. Harlow's research on monkeys shows that infant monkeys form attachment bonds even with abusive mothers (in the experimental setup, the abusive 'mother' was a monkey made out of fabric who delivered mild shocks to the infant monkey or flung the infant monkey across the arena). 
早年形成的依恋纽带为未来的人际关系、互动、性格特征和心理健康奠定了基础。[22] 婴儿通常与父母或直接照顾者形成依恋。 哈洛对猴子的研究表明，即使与虐待的母亲，幼猴也会形成依恋纽带（在实验设置中，虐待的“母亲”是一只由织物制成的猴子，它对幼猴进行轻微的电击或将幼猴扔过竞技场）。These findings also apply to human attachment bonds. Even in situations where immediate caregivers are abusive, human infants still tend to attach to them; rejection from a caregiver only enhances the efforts to increase proximity to them and establish an attachment bond with them.[19]
Furthermore, in situations of danger, humans seek increased attachment. When ordinary pathways of attachment are unavailable, people tend to turn to their abusers. This leads to strong bonds and deep emotional connections with abusers. This attachment—both to abusive caregivers and to other abusers in the absence of a main caregiver—may be adaptive in the short run as it may aid survival. But in the long run, this attachment is maladaptive and can lay the foundation for, increase vulnerability to, and even directly lead to trauma bonding.

Stockholm syndrome[edit]
The concept of trauma bonding is often conflated with Stockholm syndrome. Although there are overarching similarities between the two, especially in the context of developing an emotional bond with one's abuser, trauma bonding and Stockholm syndrome are distinct from one another. The main difference is the direction of the relationship.[1]
In other words, in the case of Stockholm syndrome, the emotional connection is reciprocal, such that the abuser also appears to develop an emotional connection towards the abused and harbor positive feelings for the abused, in addition to the abused developing an emotional bond with the abuser.[1]

Realms of existence[edit]
This section needs expansion with: how a victim will try to preserve an abusive relationship (accusing innocent people, confabulating personal injury stories, etc.). You can help by adding to it. (December 2021)
In abusive relationships[edit]


Although the victim may disclose the abuse, the trauma bond means that the victim may wish to receive comfort from the very person who abused them.


PACE UK[23]
Unhealthy, or traumatic, bonding occurs between people in an abusive relationship. The bond is stronger for people who have grown up in abusive households and who believe abuse to be a normal part of relationships.[13] On the psychometric scale for Stockholm syndrome, the three main components are: justifying an abuser through cognitive distortions, damage, ongoing psychological effects of abuse, and love.[6]
Initially, the abuser is inconsistent in approach, increasing in intensity over time. As the bond progresses, it may become more difficult for victims to leave abusers with whom they have bonded.[13]
Fear, children, and financial constraints may be factors preventing victims from leaving abusive relationships.[24]

Battered women[edit]
Initial research about battered women held the view that a victim's return to an abusive relationship was an indicator of a flawed personality and, more specifically, masochism.[12] However, this view was perpetuated by the 'just-world fallacy', the cognitive bias towards the idea that people "get what is coming for them". The tendency to victim-blame arises from the belief that the world is a just and fair place where the victim is seen as deserving of any negative consequences. However, research on battered women and research on traumatic bonding have shown that that is not the case. In terms of battered women's decision to stay in or return to an abusive relationship, many factors are at play, ranging from family history and role expectations to access to resources to the dynamics of the relationship itself.[12] A crucial part of the relationship's dynamic is the existence of a trauma bond. Maltreatment interspersed with periods of kindness aids in the formation of a trauma bond that makes the victim harbor positive feelings towards the abuser.[12]
Among battered women, a three-phase process can explain the intermittent reward-punishment cycle. During phase one, there is a gradual increase in tension, followed by an "explosive battering incident" in phase two, which is then followed by a peaceful expression of love and affection from the abuser during phase three. These phases' recurring and cyclical nature gives rise to a trauma bond.[2]

Sex trafficking[edit]
Trauma bonds are extremely common in situations of sex trafficking, child grooming, commercial sexual exploitation of children (CSEC), and pimp-prostitute relationships.

Grooming[edit]
Child grooming involves establishing and maintaining trauma bonds between the child and the abuser. Along with the factors of power imbalance and intermittent reinforcement that contribute to trauma bonding, child grooming also necessitates gaining the trust of those around the child. Grooming also involves gaining the child's trust while simultaneously violating their boundaries. Treats and trips are used as bribes to both gain access to the child as well as ensure that they comply.[25] Intense attachments coupled with cognitive distortions deepen the bond.
A 2019 case study explores the life of one individual who was groomed. The victim's perception of the abuser as a benefactor, a substitute parent, and a mind controller all contributed to the development of a traumatic bond between the victim and the abuser.[25] In terms of being a benefactor, the abuser in this case study went above and beyond to give the victim what they needed. From getting the victim a job to gifting them a plot of land for their first house, the abuser was always present as a benefactor. The abuser also acted as a substitute parent, advising and offering emotional support in times of crisis. The roles of the abuser as a benefactor and substitute parent constituted the good treatment necessary to establish a trauma bond. In contrast, the abuser's role as a mind controller involved controlling and dominating tendencies that emulated being brainwashed.[25] This combination of perceptions established a traumatic bond that the victim found incredibly difficult to break because rejecting the emotional connection as a whole would also involve rejecting the perks and benefits—the trips, the gifts, the treats, the confidante, and the caretaker.
Child grooming can be understood from a developmental perspective as well, and the relationship between the victim and the abuser evolves across the lifespan. Grooming starts when the child is extremely young—the trust of the child and the family is acquired. The child is given immense attention and is showered with gifts.[25] As the individual matures and enters adolescence, the abuser becomes a confidante and a benefactor. In the case study mentioned previously, the abuser gave the victim career advice, picked him up, and dropped him off at school. Then, at the onset of adulthood, the abuser provided the victim with land to build their home and became the person the victim brought their partner home to. As the victim's developmental needs evolved, so did the abuser's response, such that the only thing constant was the victim's need for affection. In other words, the abuser was "able to capitalize on [the victim's] relational needs" until the victim was able to meet those needs in other ways.[25]

Commercial sexual exploitation of children (CSEC)[edit]
The commercial sexual exploitation of children (CSEC) can cause debilitating physical and psychological trauma. Along with causing functional impairments, it can amplify risk-taking behaviors and increase impulse dysregulation, further compromising the child's ability to conceptualize, comprehend, establish, and maintain boundaries. This can lead to confusion regarding what safety, affection, intimacy, and kindness entail, resulting in the formation of a trauma bond with the abuser or trafficker that is based on skewed perceptions of safety and kindness.[1] The trauma bond deepens and strengthens when isolation and threats to survival increase, forcing the victim to depend almost entirely on the abuser for survival and protection. This increased emotional dependence on the abuser normalizes the emotional violence experienced by the victim at the hands of the abuser, and gradually, the victim develops a sense of trust and safety, albeit skewed, towards the abuser.[1]

Trauma-coercive bond[edit]
Trauma bonding thrives in the presence of a power imbalance and intermittent reward/punishment behavior. Trauma-coercive bonding, on the other hand, has two additional elements: social isolation and the perceived inability to escape the situation. Since these two elements are crucial to the experiences of victims of CSEC, their bonds with their abusers are better described as trauma-coercive bonds rather than simply as trauma bonds. The element of coercion concreted by social isolation and the perceived inability to escape makes the trauma bond more complex and far more deeply rooted.[1] The use of coercive trauma bonding encapsulates the psycho-social dynamics of a relationship between a victim and a perpetrator of CSEC.

Intimate partner violence (IPV)[edit]
IPV has been defined as physical, sexual, psychological, economic, or stalking abuse, both concrete and menaced, perpetuated by current or ex-partners. Trauma bonding is used to solidify this type of relationship by rationalizing and/or minimizing a violent partner's behavior, self-blame, and reporting love in the context of fear.

Parent-child relationships[edit]
Trauma bonds in parent-child or caregiver-child dynamics can be borne from abuse, neglect, or incestuous relationships.[26]

Abuse and/or neglect[edit]
Children of dismissive caregivers or cruel caregivers can develop insecure attachments, which can be very dysfunctional. Inconsistencies in reward and punishment (i.e., intermittent reinforcement of good and bad treatment) can highlight the affection the child receives from the parent, forcing a split between the abuse and the kindness such that the child seeks to form an overall positive view of the caregiver and thus focuses only on the affection and kindness they receive.[15][8] Overall, a trauma bond develops such that the child's sense of self is derived from their emotional dependence on the authority figure, who, in this case, is the parent and/or caregiver.

Incest[edit]
Incestuous relationships between parents and children cultivate trauma bonds similar to those prevalent in victims of sex trafficking. All participants in a 1994 study by Jane Kay Hedberg on trauma in adult incest survivors demonstrated some trauma bonding with their abusers.[27] There was a positive correlation between the pervasiveness of the trauma bond and the amount of contact the victim or the victim's close family members had with the abuser: those who self-reported less pervasive trauma also reported sustained contact with their abuser, while those who self-reported more pervasive trauma demonstrated an active avoidance of maintaining a relationship with their abuser. In incestuous parent-child dynamics, the study found that maintaining an unhealthy relationship with the abuser contributes to trauma and sustains the trauma bond.[27] However, Hedberg cautions against generalizing findings from the study since the sample was small (n = 11) and wasn't representative of the general population of incest survivors.[footnote 1]
This aligns with the idea that trauma bonds are toxic and difficult to leave due to the inherent power imbalance, which, in parent-child relationships, is even more pervasive than in other situations. Incestuous relationships also have an added layer of betrayal trauma, which arises from the exploitation of the victim's trust, resulting in a feeling of betrayal.[22]

Military (tours of duty)[edit]
Trauma bonds can develop in military settings. The literature demonstrates this specifically in the context of tours of duty, wherein military personnel are deployed in hostile environments or areas of combat. A 2019 study exploring this specific phenomenon sought to understand the traumatic bond developed between Japanese soldiers and Korean 'comfort women' in the midst of World War II.[28] The trauma, in this case, was two-fold: not only did the trauma bond develop in an abused-abuser dynamic, but the trauma itself was also a result of and was perpetuated by the war. While the relationships provided the Japanese soldiers with emotional relief and an escape from the violence of the war and the tyranny of the higher-ranking officers, they also provided the Korean 'comfort women' with much-desired protection and kindness from the soldiers.[28]
Soldiers would behave aggressively and violently towards the 'comfort women' and often sexually exploit them. They would use intimidation tactics to assert dominance and foster coercion. However, this abuse would be interspersed with kindness and empathy from the soldiers, whose moods and subsequent behavior and interactions were highly contingent on the time and context of the ongoing war.[28] Nonetheless, the intermittent kindness allowed the formation and maintenance of a trauma bond. Intermittent rewards were sometimes also more tangible, in the form of food, outings, and physical protection. However, protection and emotional support were pivotal in maintaining the trauma bonds and far more important than food and outings. The Korean 'comfort women' eventually came to be emotionally dependent on the Japanese soldiers and began to relate this dependence with their own sense of power, thereby establishing a trauma bond that, for some, persisted even after the war was over.[28]

Outcomes[edit]
Trauma bonding has several short-term and long-term impacts on the abused. It can force people to stay in abusive relationships, negatively affect self-image and self-esteem, perpetuate transgenerational cycles of abuse, and result in adverse mental health outcomes like an increased likelihood of developing depression and/or bipolar disorder.[9][8][5][1]

Staying in abusive relationships[edit]
Owing to the debilitating psychological manipulation involved in the development of a trauma bond, abused people tend to stay in abusive relationships, mainly because the perceived consequences of leaving the relationship seem far more negative than the consequences of staying in the abusive relationship.[6][2]
In such relationships, maltreatment is often interspersed with fragments of solace and peace that involve the expression of love, kindness, affection, and/or general friendliness from the abuser towards the abused.[6] This intermittent reinforcement of a reward (here, the abuser's love and kindness) amidst all the abuse becomes what the victim begins to hold on to. Thus, victims tend to become emotionally dependent on the abuser and construct the belief that their survival is contingent upon receiving the abuser's love.[6] Victims thereby begin to formulate their sense of identity (a form of self) around receiving the abuser's affection, which points to what could be gaslighting. Kindness and affection from the abuser amidst the abuse become a focal point for the victim's emotional dependence. This dependency is characterized by the belief that their survival is contingent on the abuser's love and affection, leading victims to construct their sense of identity and self-worth around this dynamic.[29] Additionally, the provision of intermittent love and affection makes the victim cling to the hope that things can change.[11] Furthermore, self-blame, the fear of social stigma and embarrassment, the fear of loneliness in the absence of a partner, and the lack of or poor social support from other family and friends also contribute to individuals remaining in abusive relationships.[11]

Perpetuation of transgenerational cycles of abuse[edit]
People who have experienced trauma and traumatic bonds can, knowingly or unknowingly, repeat the cycle of abuse. In other words, victims who were traumatically bonded with abusers may grow to become abusers themselves. The abuse that victims inflict may or may not involve trauma bonding.[9]
For instance, in a 2018 study on convicted child murderers, researchers found that caregivers who committed child homicide (murdered their child or care receiver) had experienced traumatic experiences and had trauma bonds with abusers in their early lives.[8] Individuals with cruel and/or dismissive caregivers are likely to develop insecure attachments that result in a host of problems, including emotion deregulation and an attitude of confusion towards the caregiver, who becomes a source of comfort as well as fear. These adverse attachments can manifest in an individual's relationship with their own children as well. Attachment issues and painful memories of trauma bonds with their own caregivers can be triggered, and individuals may demonstrate heightened and disproportionate aggression toward their child, some culminating in homicide.[8] In this study, participants experienced physical abuse, sexual abuse, a lack of protection from external dangers, abandonment, emotional rejection, and more from their caregivers. Nonetheless, participants expressed unconditional love towards their caregivers, justified by wanting to maintain an overall positive view of them.[8] In their continued efforts to form an emotional connection, a trauma bond was fostered. These experiences had a severe negative impact on their relationship and bonding with their own children, contributing to "affectionless, unempathetic interpersonal behavior" that inflated aggressive and violent tendencies triggered by vulnerabilities.[8]

Neurophysiological outcomes[edit]
The experience of being in a trauma bond can have adverse neurological and neurophysiological outcomes. The body of the victim of a trauma bond is in a perpetual 'fight-or-flight' response state, which can increase cortisol levels that can have a cascading effect and trigger other hormones. 
Persistent, chronic stress can also hamper the cellular response in the body, thereby negatively impacting immunity, organ health, mood, energy levels, and more.[1] In the long run, this can cause epigenetic changes as well. Furthermore, a study conducted in 2015 found that establishing a trauma bond in infancy is also linked with amygdala dysfunction, neurobehavioral deficits, and increased vulnerability to psychiatric disorders later on in life.[30] Psychological abuse is correlated with sleep-related impairments. Disruption in sleep patterns leads to adverse neurophysiological problems, such as an increase in anxiety and irritability. For victims of psychological abuse, the increase in cortisol affects the brain in such a manner that it allows the trauma bonding to be strengthened.[31]

Adverse mental health outcomes[edit]
Trauma bonding is linked to several adverse mental health and well-being outcomes. Due to the abuse and the emotional dependence on their abusers, victims tend to develop an incredibly negative self-image. "Controlling, restricting, degrading, isolating, or dominating" abuse has a crippling effect on the self-image and self-esteem of the abused, and this psychological abuse is far more dangerous than physical abuse.[5] In a 2010 study on battered women labeling themselves as "stupid", researchers found that victims who felt like they allowed themselves to be mistreated and victims who stayed in abusive relationships labeled themselves as "stupid" for doing so.[10] This further contributes to a negative self-image and the maintenance of low self-esteem, both of which foster a poor self-concept, which, in turn, adversely impacts mental well-being. The same was observed in the case study mentioned previously on grooming.[25]
Trauma bonding can also lead to dissociative symptoms that could be a self-preservation and/or coping mechanism. Neurobiological changes can also affect brain development and hamper learning. The internalization of psychological manipulation and trauma can cause anxiety and increase the likelihood of engaging in risk-taking behaviors.[1] Furthermore, the isolation involved in trauma bonding can foster a generally skewed sense of trust, making victims vulnerable to situations that may retraumatize or revictimize them. Victims may also tend to either completely dismiss or minimize dangerous, damaging behaviors and violence around them.[1]
Trauma bonds in parent-child relationships (wherein the child is the victim and the parent is the abuser) can also lead to depressive symptoms later in life.[9] In a 2017 study exploring this, it was found that an "affectionless control" parenting style, characterized by high protection and low care from parents, was a major predictor of depressive symptomology for the victim. In other words, the presence of poor parental bonding coupled with childhood trauma bonds increased the likelihood of the child developing depressive symptoms in the future. A negative self-image is formed when feelings of inadequacy and hopelessness persist and are reinforced by caregivers. Perpetual efforts to seek secure emotional attachments reap no rewards, and a trauma bond facilitates a negative core schema that influences perceptions and interactions throughout one's life.[9] This can give rise to mental health issues such as depression, bipolar disorder, mania, suicidality, and substance abuse that can be pervasive and lifelong.

027. Attachment bonds formed during early life lay the foundation for interpersonal relationships, interactions, personality characteristics, and mental health in the future.[22] Infants usually form attachments with their parents or immediate caregivers. Harlow's research on monkeys shows that infant monkeys form attachment bonds even with abusive mothers (in the experimental setup, the abusive 'mother' was a monkey made out of fabric who delivered mild shocks to the infant monkey or flung the infant monkey across the arena). 
早年形成的依恋纽带为未来的人际关系、互动、性格特征和心理健康奠定了基础。[22] 婴儿通常与父母或直接照顾者形成依恋。 哈洛对猴子的研究表明，即使与虐待的母亲，幼猴也会形成依恋纽带（在实验设置中，虐待的“母亲”是一只由织物制成的猴子，它对幼猴进行轻微的电击或将幼猴扔过竞技场）。These findings also apply to human attachment bonds. Even in situations where immediate caregivers are abusive, human infants still tend to attach to them; rejection from a caregiver only enhances the efforts to increase proximity to them and establish an attachment bond with them.[19]
Furthermore, in situations of danger, humans seek increased attachment. When ordinary pathways of attachment are unavailable, people tend to turn to their abusers. This leads to strong bonds and deep emotional connections with abusers. This attachment—both to abusive caregivers and to other abusers in the absence of a main caregiver—may be adaptive in the short run as it may aid survival. But in the long run, this attachment is maladaptive and can lay the foundation for, increase vulnerability to, and even directly lead to trauma bonding.

Stockholm syndrome[edit]
The concept of trauma bonding is often conflated with Stockholm syndrome. Although there are overarching similarities between the two, especially in the context of developing an emotional bond with one's abuser, trauma bonding and Stockholm syndrome are distinct from one another. The main difference is the direction of the relationship.[1]
In other words, in the case of Stockholm syndrome, the emotional connection is reciprocal, such that the abuser also appears to develop an emotional connection towards the abused and harbor positive feelings for the abused, in addition to the abused developing an emotional bond with the abuser.[1]

Realms of existence[edit]
This section needs expansion with: how a victim will try to preserve an abusive relationship (accusing innocent people, confabulating personal injury stories, etc.). You can help by adding to it. (December 2021)
In abusive relationships[edit]


Although the victim may disclose the abuse, the trauma bond means that the victim may wish to receive comfort from the very person who abused them.


PACE UK[23]
Unhealthy, or traumatic, bonding occurs between people in an abusive relationship. The bond is stronger for people who have grown up in abusive households and who believe abuse to be a normal part of relationships.[13] On the psychometric scale for Stockholm syndrome, the three main components are: justifying an abuser through cognitive distortions, damage, ongoing psychological effects of abuse, and love.[6]
Initially, the abuser is inconsistent in approach, increasing in intensity over time. As the bond progresses, it may become more difficult for victims to leave abusers with whom they have bonded.[13]
Fear, children, and financial constraints may be factors preventing victims from leaving abusive relationships.[24]

Battered women[edit]
Initial research about battered women held the view that a victim's return to an abusive relationship was an indicator of a flawed personality and, more specifically, masochism.[12] However, this view was perpetuated by the 'just-world fallacy', the cognitive bias towards the idea that people "get what is coming for them". The tendency to victim-blame arises from the belief that the world is a just and fair place where the victim is seen as deserving of any negative consequences. However, research on battered women and research on traumatic bonding have shown that that is not the case. In terms of battered women's decision to stay in or return to an abusive relationship, many factors are at play, ranging from family history and role expectations to access to resources to the dynamics of the relationship itself.[12] A crucial part of the relationship's dynamic is the existence of a trauma bond. Maltreatment interspersed with periods of kindness aids in the formation of a trauma bond that makes the victim harbor positive feelings towards the abuser.[12]
Among battered women, a three-phase process can explain the intermittent reward-punishment cycle. During phase one, there is a gradual increase in tension, followed by an "explosive battering incident" in phase two, which is then followed by a peaceful expression of love and affection from the abuser during phase three. These phases' recurring and cyclical nature gives rise to a trauma bond.[2]

Sex trafficking[edit]
Trauma bonds are extremely common in situations of sex trafficking, child grooming, commercial sexual exploitation of children (CSEC), and pimp-prostitute relationships.

Grooming[edit]
Child grooming involves establishing and maintaining trauma bonds between the child and the abuser. Along with the factors of power imbalance and intermittent reinforcement that contribute to trauma bonding, child grooming also necessitates gaining the trust of those around the child. Grooming also involves gaining the child's trust while simultaneously violating their boundaries. Treats and trips are used as bribes to both gain access to the child as well as ensure that they comply.[25] Intense attachments coupled with cognitive distortions deepen the bond.
A 2019 case study explores the life of one individual who was groomed. The victim's perception of the abuser as a benefactor, a substitute parent, and a mind controller all contributed to the development of a traumatic bond between the victim and the abuser.[25] In terms of being a benefactor, the abuser in this case study went above and beyond to give the victim what they needed. From getting the victim a job to gifting them a plot of land for their first house, the abuser was always present as a benefactor. The abuser also acted as a substitute parent, advising and offering emotional support in times of crisis. The roles of the abuser as a benefactor and substitute parent constituted the good treatment necessary to establish a trauma bond. In contrast, the abuser's role as a mind controller involved controlling and dominating tendencies that emulated being brainwashed.[25] This combination of perceptions established a traumatic bond that the victim found incredibly difficult to break because rejecting the emotional connection as a whole would also involve rejecting the perks and benefits—the trips, the gifts, the treats, the confidante, and the caretaker.
Child grooming can be understood from a developmental perspective as well, and the relationship between the victim and the abuser evolves across the lifespan. Grooming starts when the child is extremely young—the trust of the child and the family is acquired. The child is given immense attention and is showered with gifts.[25] As the individual matures and enters adolescence, the abuser becomes a confidante and a benefactor. In the case study mentioned previously, the abuser gave the victim career advice, picked him up, and dropped him off at school. Then, at the onset of adulthood, the abuser provided the victim with land to build their home and became the person the victim brought their partner home to. As the victim's developmental needs evolved, so did the abuser's response, such that the only thing constant was the victim's need for affection. In other words, the abuser was "able to capitalize on [the victim's] relational needs" until the victim was able to meet those needs in other ways.[25]

Commercial sexual exploitation of children (CSEC)[edit]
The commercial sexual exploitation of children (CSEC) can cause debilitating physical and psychological trauma. Along with causing functional impairments, it can amplify risk-taking behaviors and increase impulse dysregulation, further compromising the child's ability to conceptualize, comprehend, establish, and maintain boundaries. This can lead to confusion regarding what safety, affection, intimacy, and kindness entail, resulting in the formation of a trauma bond with the abuser or trafficker that is based on skewed perceptions of safety and kindness.[1] The trauma bond deepens and strengthens when isolation and threats to survival increase, forcing the victim to depend almost entirely on the abuser for survival and protection. This increased emotional dependence on the abuser normalizes the emotional violence experienced by the victim at the hands of the abuser, and gradually, the victim develops a sense of trust and safety, albeit skewed, towards the abuser.[1]

Trauma-coercive bond[edit]
Trauma bonding thrives in the presence of a power imbalance and intermittent reward/punishment behavior. Trauma-coercive bonding, on the other hand, has two additional elements: social isolation and the perceived inability to escape the situation. Since these two elements are crucial to the experiences of victims of CSEC, their bonds with their abusers are better described as trauma-coercive bonds rather than simply as trauma bonds. The element of coercion concreted by social isolation and the perceived inability to escape makes the trauma bond more complex and far more deeply rooted.[1] The use of coercive trauma bonding encapsulates the psycho-social dynamics of a relationship between a victim and a perpetrator of CSEC.

Intimate partner violence (IPV)[edit]
IPV has been defined as physical, sexual, psychological, economic, or stalking abuse, both concrete and menaced, perpetuated by current or ex-partners. Trauma bonding is used to solidify this type of relationship by rationalizing and/or minimizing a violent partner's behavior, self-blame, and reporting love in the context of fear.

Parent-child relationships[edit]
Trauma bonds in parent-child or caregiver-child dynamics can be borne from abuse, neglect, or incestuous relationships.[26]

Abuse and/or neglect[edit]
Children of dismissive caregivers or cruel caregivers can develop insecure attachments, which can be very dysfunctional. Inconsistencies in reward and punishment (i.e., intermittent reinforcement of good and bad treatment) can highlight the affection the child receives from the parent, forcing a split between the abuse and the kindness such that the child seeks to form an overall positive view of the caregiver and thus focuses only on the affection and kindness they receive.[15][8] Overall, a trauma bond develops such that the child's sense of self is derived from their emotional dependence on the authority figure, who, in this case, is the parent and/or caregiver.

Incest[edit]
Incestuous relationships between parents and children cultivate trauma bonds similar to those prevalent in victims of sex trafficking. All participants in a 1994 study by Jane Kay Hedberg on trauma in adult incest survivors demonstrated some trauma bonding with their abusers.[27] There was a positive correlation between the pervasiveness of the trauma bond and the amount of contact the victim or the victim's close family members had with the abuser: those who self-reported less pervasive trauma also reported sustained contact with their abuser, while those who self-reported more pervasive trauma demonstrated an active avoidance of maintaining a relationship with their abuser. In incestuous parent-child dynamics, the study found that maintaining an unhealthy relationship with the abuser contributes to trauma and sustains the trauma bond.[27] However, Hedberg cautions against generalizing findings from the study since the sample was small (n = 11) and wasn't representative of the general population of incest survivors.[footnote 1]
This aligns with the idea that trauma bonds are toxic and difficult to leave due to the inherent power imbalance, which, in parent-child relationships, is even more pervasive than in other situations. Incestuous relationships also have an added layer of betrayal trauma, which arises from the exploitation of the victim's trust, resulting in a feeling of betrayal.[22]

Military (tours of duty)[edit]
Trauma bonds can develop in military settings. The literature demonstrates this specifically in the context of tours of duty, wherein military personnel are deployed in hostile environments or areas of combat. A 2019 study exploring this specific phenomenon sought to understand the traumatic bond developed between Japanese soldiers and Korean 'comfort women' in the midst of World War II.[28] The trauma, in this case, was two-fold: not only did the trauma bond develop in an abused-abuser dynamic, but the trauma itself was also a result of and was perpetuated by the war. While the relationships provided the Japanese soldiers with emotional relief and an escape from the violence of the war and the tyranny of the higher-ranking officers, they also provided the Korean 'comfort women' with much-desired protection and kindness from the soldiers.[28]
Soldiers would behave aggressively and violently towards the 'comfort women' and often sexually exploit them. They would use intimidation tactics to assert dominance and foster coercion. However, this abuse would be interspersed with kindness and empathy from the soldiers, whose moods and subsequent behavior and interactions were highly contingent on the time and context of the ongoing war.[28] Nonetheless, the intermittent kindness allowed the formation and maintenance of a trauma bond. Intermittent rewards were sometimes also more tangible, in the form of food, outings, and physical protection. However, protection and emotional support were pivotal in maintaining the trauma bonds and far more important than food and outings. The Korean 'comfort women' eventually came to be emotionally dependent on the Japanese soldiers and began to relate this dependence with their own sense of power, thereby establishing a trauma bond that, for some, persisted even after the war was over.[28]

Outcomes[edit]
Trauma bonding has several short-term and long-term impacts on the abused. It can force people to stay in abusive relationships, negatively affect self-image and self-esteem, perpetuate transgenerational cycles of abuse, and result in adverse mental health outcomes like an increased likelihood of developing depression and/or bipolar disorder.[9][8][5][1]

Staying in abusive relationships[edit]
Owing to the debilitating psychological manipulation involved in the development of a trauma bond, abused people tend to stay in abusive relationships, mainly because the perceived consequences of leaving the relationship seem far more negative than the consequences of staying in the abusive relationship.[6][2]
In such relationships, maltreatment is often interspersed with fragments of solace and peace that involve the expression of love, kindness, affection, and/or general friendliness from the abuser towards the abused.[6] This intermittent reinforcement of a reward (here, the abuser's love and kindness) amidst all the abuse becomes what the victim begins to hold on to. Thus, victims tend to become emotionally dependent on the abuser and construct the belief that their survival is contingent upon receiving the abuser's love.[6] Victims thereby begin to formulate their sense of identity (a form of self) around receiving the abuser's affection, which points to what could be gaslighting. Kindness and affection from the abuser amidst the abuse become a focal point for the victim's emotional dependence. This dependency is characterized by the belief that their survival is contingent on the abuser's love and affection, leading victims to construct their sense of identity and self-worth around this dynamic.[29] Additionally, the provision of intermittent love and affection makes the victim cling to the hope that things can change.[11] Furthermore, self-blame, the fear of social stigma and embarrassment, the fear of loneliness in the absence of a partner, and the lack of or poor social support from other family and friends also contribute to individuals remaining in abusive relationships.[11]

Perpetuation of transgenerational cycles of abuse[edit]
People who have experienced trauma and traumatic bonds can, knowingly or unknowingly, repeat the cycle of abuse. In other words, victims who were traumatically bonded with abusers may grow to become abusers themselves. The abuse that victims inflict may or may not involve trauma bonding.[9]
For instance, in a 2018 study on convicted child murderers, researchers found that caregivers who committed child homicide (murdered their child or care receiver) had experienced traumatic experiences and had trauma bonds with abusers in their early lives.[8] Individuals with cruel and/or dismissive caregivers are likely to develop insecure attachments that result in a host of problems, including emotion deregulation and an attitude of confusion towards the caregiver, who becomes a source of comfort as well as fear. These adverse attachments can manifest in an individual's relationship with their own children as well. Attachment issues and painful memories of trauma bonds with their own caregivers can be triggered, and individuals may demonstrate heightened and disproportionate aggression toward their child, some culminating in homicide.[8] In this study, participants experienced physical abuse, sexual abuse, a lack of protection from external dangers, abandonment, emotional rejection, and more from their caregivers. Nonetheless, participants expressed unconditional love towards their caregivers, justified by wanting to maintain an overall positive view of them.[8] In their continued efforts to form an emotional connection, a trauma bond was fostered. These experiences had a severe negative impact on their relationship and bonding with their own children, contributing to "affectionless, unempathetic interpersonal behavior" that inflated aggressive and violent tendencies triggered by vulnerabilities.[8]

Neurophysiological outcomes[edit]
The experience of being in a trauma bond can have adverse neurological and neurophysiological outcomes. The body of the victim of a trauma bond is in a perpetual 'fight-or-flight' response state, which can increase cortisol levels that can have a cascading effect and trigger other hormones. 
Persistent, chronic stress can also hamper the cellular response in the body, thereby negatively impacting immunity, organ health, mood, energy levels, and more.[1] In the long run, this can cause epigenetic changes as well. Furthermore, a study conducted in 2015 found that establishing a trauma bond in infancy is also linked with amygdala dysfunction, neurobehavioral deficits, and increased vulnerability to psychiatric disorders later on in life.[30] Psychological abuse is correlated with sleep-related impairments. Disruption in sleep patterns leads to adverse neurophysiological problems, such as an increase in anxiety and irritability. For victims of psychological abuse, the increase in cortisol affects the brain in such a manner that it allows the trauma bonding to be strengthened.[31]

Adverse mental health outcomes[edit]
Trauma bonding is linked to several adverse mental health and well-being outcomes. Due to the abuse and the emotional dependence on their abusers, victims tend to develop an incredibly negative self-image. "Controlling, restricting, degrading, isolating, or dominating" abuse has a crippling effect on the self-image and self-esteem of the abused, and this psychological abuse is far more dangerous than physical abuse.[5] In a 2010 study on battered women labeling themselves as "stupid", researchers found that victims who felt like they allowed themselves to be mistreated and victims who stayed in abusive relationships labeled themselves as "stupid" for doing so.[10] This further contributes to a negative self-image and the maintenance of low self-esteem, both of which foster a poor self-concept, which, in turn, adversely impacts mental well-being. The same was observed in the case study mentioned previously on grooming.[25]
Trauma bonding can also lead to dissociative symptoms that could be a self-preservation and/or coping mechanism. Neurobiological changes can also affect brain development and hamper learning. The internalization of psychological manipulation and trauma can cause anxiety and increase the likelihood of engaging in risk-taking behaviors.[1] Furthermore, the isolation involved in trauma bonding can foster a generally skewed sense of trust, making victims vulnerable to situations that may retraumatize or revictimize them. Victims may also tend to either completely dismiss or minimize dangerous, damaging behaviors and violence around them.[1]
Trauma bonds in parent-child relationships (wherein the child is the victim and the parent is the abuser) can also lead to depressive symptoms later in life.[9] In a 2017 study exploring this, it was found that an "affectionless control" parenting style, characterized by high protection and low care from parents, was a major predictor of depressive symptomology for the victim. In other words, the presence of poor parental bonding coupled with childhood trauma bonds increased the likelihood of the child developing depressive symptoms in the future. A negative self-image is formed when feelings of inadequacy and hopelessness persist and are reinforced by caregivers. Perpetual efforts to seek secure emotional attachments reap no rewards, and a trauma bond facilitates a negative core schema that influences perceptions and interactions throughout one's life.[9] This can give rise to mental health issues such as depression, bipolar disorder, mania, suicidality, and substance abuse that can be pervasive and lifelong.

001. 【标题】煤气灯效应 - 维基百科，自由的百科全书

002. 煤气灯效应（英语：Gaslighting）是一种心理操纵的形式，其方法是一个人或团体隐秘地让受害人逐渐开始怀疑自己，使其质疑自己的记忆力、感知力或判断力，其结果是导致受害者产生认知失调和其他变化，例如低下的自我尊重等。由于操作者使用否定、误导、矛盾和提供错误资讯，煤气灯效应使受害者心理失去稳定性，以及使受害者不再相信自己原来的信仰。在现实案例中，可以从受虐者否认先前发生过虐待事件，到虐待者意图使受害者迷失方向等怪异事件的发生。
该术语起源于剧本《煤气灯》（Gas Light，1938年，但最初在美国以“安吉尔街”为名称演出）及其1940年和1944年的改编版电影。该术语已用于临床心理学文献[1] :31–46 [2]以及政治评论和哲学中。 [3]

词源[编辑]
 在1944年的电影《煤气灯下》中的英格丽·褒曼 
该术语起源于1938年的舞台剧《煤气灯下》[4]，以及1940年和1944年[5]发行的电影改编版中，对受害者的系统性心理操纵。在故事中，丈夫试图通过环境中的小细节操纵妻子和其他人，并坚持让妻子认为她自己错了，错误地记住事情或在指出这些变化时有妄想的可能，从而说服妻子相信是她自己疯了。这部戏剧的主题包含“虐待”，丈夫如何在家里故意让煤气灯缓慢变暗，同时又假装什么都没有改变，目的是使妻子怀疑自己的看法；他还在封闭的阁楼中点灯寻找被他谋杀的女人的珠宝，他搜寻时会发出很大的声音，包括自言自语的声音。妻子一再要求丈夫确认她对调暗的灯光、噪音等声音的感知，但他刻意忽视妻子提及的现实，一直坚持表示灯光没有改变，而是妻子发疯[6]:8；丈夫打算借此将妻子送进精神病院，之后他将能够获得对她的授权书，并可以更有效地进行搜索。
自从1960年代以来，“煤气灯下”一词被广泛用于描述操纵某人对现实感知的努力[7]；1970年代至今，该术语已经被文学用以描述这种行为心理分析[8]。在1980年所出版关于儿童性虐待的书籍中，弗洛伦斯·拉什根据该剧对乔治·丘克（George Cukor）的 《煤气灯》（Gaslight，1944）进行总结写道：“即使在今天，‘煤气灯’一词也用来描述企图破坏他人对现实的看法。”[9]。

特点[编辑]
煤气灯效应涉及一个或一组加害者，以及至少第二个人（受害者），可以是有意识也可以是无意识，并且是秘密进行的，因此所产生的情感虐待不会被公开[10]。
煤气灯效应取决于“首先说服受害者的想法是被歪曲的，其次说服受害者所接受来自加害者的想法是正确和真实的”[1]:45。煤气灯效应在受害者中引起认知失调，通常是充满情感的认知失调[11]，并使受害者对自己的思维、感知和现实检验提出质疑，从而容易引起他们的自尊低落、令人不安的想法和影响，并可能促进混乱、焦虑以及抑郁，在某些情况下甚至导致思觉失调:33–34。当受害者对自己的心理能力失去信心并发展出一种“习得性失助”之后[12]，他们就更容易受到加害者控制:34，而受害者往往是权力和地位较低者[13]:7。 
加害者或受害者的角色可以在给定的关系中摇摆，并且通常每个参与者都确信自己是受害者[14]。当一群人充当加害者时，煤气灯效应会通过该小组成员“微小、通常看不见的行动，通过积累和加强力量而对其造成损害”[15]，个人和团体已将煤气灯效应用于“对其他个人和团体的心理功能进行人际和社会控制”[1]:6。
认知偏差是指听者主要由于某样事物被频繁重复而开始相信它的一种现象。在煤气灯效应期间，该现象可能会发生于受害者身上[12]。

精神分析的解释[编辑]
心理分析学家维克多·卡莱夫（Victor Calef）和爱德华·温斯赫尔（Edward Weinshel）在1981年的一篇文章中指出，煤气灯效应涉及从施害者到受害者心理内容的投射和注入（“转移”）[14]，心理内容则包括情感、知觉、冲动、抵抗、幻想、妄想以及冲突。作者探讨受害者为何可能“倾向于融合并吸收他人将其外部化后投射到他们身上的东西”的多种原因，并得出结论认为，煤气灯效应可能是“一种非常复杂的高度结构化配置，其中包含许多精神因素的贡献”。 
后来，精神病医生西奥多·多帕特（Theodore Dorpat）将此种受害者无意识心理内容的“转移”描述为“投射性认同​（英语）”的一个例子[16][1]:5–6, 40。在受害者并未意识到自己正受到煤气灯效应影响时，投射性认同对其最有效，若受害者自身也认同“转移”的内容（所投射的内容），则它将具有破坏性；但是，当受害人变得能够不相信且不认同投射性认同所产生的负面内投时，这些影响就会被抵消。

人格障碍[编辑]
社交变态者和自恋者[17]经常使用煤气灯效应来虐待和破坏受害者的心理认知。社会变态者一贯违背社会道德规范，违反法律并利用他人，且通常也是令人信服的说谎者，有时甚至是迷人的说谎者，他们始终否认有不法行为；因此，一些受到社会变态者伤害的人可能会怀疑自己的看法[18]。一些虐待配偶身体的人可能断然否认自己曾行使暴力，从而对伴侣产生煤气灯效果[2]；煤气灯效应也可以在亲子关系中发生，其中父母、子女或双方说谎并试图破坏对方的心理知觉[19]。

精神病学[编辑]
在精神病人的住院设施中，患者与工作人员之间发现煤气灯效应现象[20]。Dorpat在1996年的一本书中表示，“煤气灯效应和其他人际关系控制方法被心理健康领域专业人士以及其他人广泛使用”，因为它们是塑造他人行为的有效方法[1]:45；他另表示，临床医生使用具有威权主义态度的人际控制的秘密方法，例如煤气灯效应:xiii–xxi，他也建议临床医生采取更多非指导性和平等主义的态度和方法:225，“将患者视为积极的合作者和平等伙伴”:246。

浪漫关系[编辑]
在人际关系中，加害者“需要是正确的”，以便“保留（自己的）自我意识”和“（自己）在世界上拥有权力的意识”；受害者允许加害者“定义（自身的）现实感”，以至于受害者将对方“理想化”并“寻求（对方的）认可”[6]:3。心理操纵可包括使受害者质疑自己的记忆、知觉和理智，加害者可能会使用轻蔑的语言无效化 (invalidate) 受害者的感受，比如：“你疯了。别那么敏感。不要偏执。我只是在开玩笑！我很担心；我认为你身体不好。”等[3]。 
心理学家吉尔·罗杰斯（Jill Rogers）和黛安·弗林斯塔德（ Diane Follingstad）表示，这种忽视可能会对心理健康产生不利影响。他们将心理虐待描述为：“通过胁迫、控制、口头虐待、监视、孤立、威胁、嫉妒、屈辱、操纵、劣等对待、创造敌对环境，在性和忠诚方面伤害伴侣，在情感上和/或身体上对伴侣有所隐瞒等做法，以伤害他人的一系列令人厌恶的行为。”[21]。在一些婚姻不忠的案例中，人们发现煤气灯效应现象：“治疗师可能通过错误地标记受害者的反应加剧受害者的痛苦。配偶的煤气灯行为可能导致某些受害者产生‘神经衰弱’甚至在某些最恶劣的情况下自杀。”[19][22]。
心理学家格特鲁德·泽蒙·加斯和威廉·尼科尔斯在其1988年的文章〈煤气灯效应：婚姻综合症〉中研究男人的婚外情及其对妻子的影响[22]，他们描述一个男人如何试图说服妻子她在捕风捉影，而不是承认自己有外遇：“一个妻子在自己家里接电话，却在不经意间偷听到丈夫在出差途中和女友幽会的计划。”，丈夫质疑她的感知证据加以否认：“我没有和任何女友通电话。你一定在做梦。”。 
罗杰斯（Rogers）和弗林斯坦德（Follingstand）考察女性的心理虐待经历，这些经历可以作为抑郁、焦虑、躯体化、自杀意念和生活功能的症状以及临床水平的预测指标。他们得出结论，心理虐待会影响妇女的心理健康状态，但是与实体的虐待相比，人们感知到的性格、关系模式和反应方式的负面变化是心理健康结果的更有效指标[21]。心理治疗师斯蒂芬妮·莫尔顿·萨基斯（Stephanie Moulton Sarkis）解释说，“保持一定程度的认知失调才能与煤气灯效应的使用者保持连结”，而在这种情况下，“解决认知失调的最健康方法”涉及“让自己离开或远离操纵煤气灯效应的人”[13]:24–25。 

标志和方法[编辑]
如帕特里夏·埃文斯（Patricia Evans）所述，观察到的施虐者有七个“警告标志”：[23]

向受害者的隐瞒讯息；
反击讯息以符合施虐者的观点；
冷处理讯息；
经常以玩笑的形式进行口头虐待；
阻止和转移受害者对外界的关注；
轻描淡写（“最小化”）受害者的价值；
通过逐渐削弱受害者及其思维过程来破坏受害者心理认知。
埃文斯（Evans）认为有必要了解这些警告标志，以便从该处开始治疗过程[23]。
心理学家埃里诺·格林伯格（Elinor Greenberg）描述三种常见的煤气灯效应方法：[17]

隐藏。虐待者可能向受害者隐瞒或掩盖他们所做的事情。虐待者不会感到羞耻，反而会说服受害者怀疑自己对情况的看法，并把责任归咎于自己。
不断变化。滥用者感到有必要改变受害者的某些东西。无论是受害者的着装或行为方式，他们都希望受害者融入自己的幻想中。如果受害者不遵守，虐待者可能会说服受害者认为自己实际上还不够好。
关系中的控制。虐待者可能希望完全控制受害者并对其拥有控制权。在这种情况下，施虐者会试图将他们与其他朋友和家人隔离开来，以便只有他们才能影响受害者的思想和行为。虐待者享受受害者完全受自己控制的权力感和控制感。
离婚程序教练林赛·埃里森（Lindsey Ellison）所描述的施虐者的最终目标是让受害者重新考量自己的选择并质疑自己的理智，使他们更加依赖施虐者[24]，当中用来降低受害者自尊心的一种策略是施虐者在无视和照顾受害者之间交替，从而使受害者降低对情感的期望，并认为自己不值得他人付出感情[查证请求]。

性别角色[编辑]
心理治疗师斯蒂芬妮·莫尔顿·萨基斯观察发现，煤气灯效应存在于她所治疗的约30至40％的夫妻中，她说：“男性和女性有同样的可能性进行煤气灯效应”[25]，并表示：“据我们所知，性别在这里同等地表现出来。”[13]:27；她进一步解释，我们倾向于认为使用煤气灯效应的是男性居多，因为“男人往往更不愿意（也许是不好意思）与他人谈及女性伴侣的情感虐待”。:27
社会学家佩奇·斯威特（Paige Sweet）在社会不平等和举足轻重的家庭暴力亲密关系背景下研究煤气灯效应认为，“这种策略是性别化的，因为它们依赖于女性气质与非理性的联系。”[26]。
根据哲学教授凯特·艾布拉姆森（Kate Abramson）的观点，煤气灯效应的行为与性别歧视并没有特别的联系，尽管与男性相比，女性往往更经常成为受煤气灯效应影响的对象[3]。艾布拉姆森对此解释认为，这是社会条件的结果，并说：“这是性别歧视结构的一部分，认为女性比男性更没自信，对我们自身所抱持的观点、信念、反应和看法的怀疑程度要高于男性。而煤气灯效应旨在破坏某人的观点、信念、反应和看法。各种形式自我怀疑的性别歧视规范导致我们更易于出现此情形。”艾布拉姆森说，煤气灯效应的最后“阶段”是严重的临床抑郁症。哲学教授希尔德·林德曼（Hilde Lindemann）特别在谈及妇女时表示，在这种情况下，受害者抵抗操纵的能力取决于“她相信自身判断的能力”，建立心理认知的“对抗区”可以帮助受害者重新获得“普通水平的自由性”[27]。

政治事务[编辑]
专栏作家莫琳·道德（Maureen Dowd）是最早在政治背景下使用该术语的人之一[28]，她描述比尔·克林顿政府使用这项技术使纽特·金里奇受到小侮辱的意图，目的是激怒他向公众提出“歇斯底里”的投诉[29][30]。 
心理学家布莱恩特·韦尔奇（Bryant Welch）在其2008年的《混乱状态：政治操纵与对美国思想的攻击》一书中，描述该技术在现代传播时代开始在美国政治中的普遍性。 
记者弗里达·吉蒂斯（Frida Ghitis）用“点燃汽油”一词形容俄罗斯的全球关系。在俄罗斯特工活跃在克里米亚的同时，俄罗斯官员不断否认相关人员的存在，并操纵对政治团体的不信任来支持他们。[31]
《纽约时报杂志》，BBC和《青少年时尚》杂志的记者以及心理学家布莱恩特·韦尔奇、罗伯特·费尔德曼和莉亚·麦克艾拉斯都描述唐纳德·特朗普在2016年美国总统大选期间的某些行为以及他担任总统期间的举动[29][32][33][34][35]。新闻学教授本·雅格达（Ben Yagoda）在2017年1月《高等教育纪事报》中写道，由于特朗普的举动，“加油”一词再次成为热门话题，他说特朗普的“习惯性倾向说‘X’，接着在往后的某个日子里愤愤不平。”并声明“我没有说‘X’。实际上，我永远也不会梦想说‘X’”，为该术语带来新的注解[28]。
此外，宗派团体的领导者和追随者利用煤气灯效应以确保整合任何可能偏离团体的成员[36]。

工作职场[编辑]
当人们做的事情导致同事对自己及其行为提出质疑，而这对当事人的职业表现评价有所损害时，便会在工作场所引起人们关注[37]；受害者在此情境中可能被排除在任职场域的讨论外，成为他人讨论的流言蜚语，长期受到抹黑或质疑导致其信心遭破坏，施害者可能会将相关谈话转移到感知到的错误上[38]。任何人都可以操纵煤气灯效应，当施害者拥有权力时将特别有害[39]。

流行文化[编辑]
流行乐队Steely Dan在其2000年发行的专辑“ Two Against Nature ”中演唱一首名为“ Gaslighting Abbie”的歌曲。
2016年的神秘和心理惊悚片《列车上的女孩》（The Girl on the Train）探索了乘汽油对主角雷切尔（Rachel）的直接影响[29]，曾身为暴力虐待者的瑞秋前夫汤姆是受害者。雷切尔患有严重的抑郁症并且会酗酒，当蕾切尔喝醉时，他总是告诉瑞秋，她做了一些她不记得的可怕事情[40]。 
煤气灯效应是英国广播公司广播电视剧《弓箭手》中2016年情节的主题。这个故事描述海伦·阿切尔（Helen Archer）的伴侣和后来的丈夫罗布·蒂切纳（Rob Titchener）在两年期间对他们的情感虐待，引起公众对该现象的广泛讨论[41]。
在2018年的几个月中，煤气灯效应是NBC电视剧《我们的生活》中的主要情节。剧中角色加比·埃尔南德斯（Gabi Hernandez）在加比因谋杀阿比盖尔（Abigail）在该系列中所犯下的罪行而陷害后，向她最好的朋友阿比盖尔（Abigail Deveroux）放火[42]。 
2020年3月，Dixie Chicks发行一首名为“ Gaslighter ”的歌曲，这是他们即将发行的专辑Gaslighter的主打曲目，歌曲中提到“gaslighting”一词[43]，其灵感来自于主唱娜塔莉·缅因与丈夫演员阿德里安·帕斯达尔（Adrian Pasdar）离婚[44]。

003. 该术语起源于剧本《煤气灯》（Gas Light，1938年，但最初在美国以“安吉尔街”为名称演出）及其1940年和1944年的改编版电影。该术语已用于临床心理学文献[1] :31–46 [2]以及政治评论和哲学中。 [3]

004. 该术语起源于1938年的舞台剧《煤气灯下》[4]，以及1940年和1944年[5]发行的电影改编版中，对受害者的系统性心理操纵。在故事中，丈夫试图通过环境中的小细节操纵妻子和其他人，并坚持让妻子认为她自己错了，错误地记住事情或在指出这些变化时有妄想的可能，从而说服妻子相信是她自己疯了。这部戏剧的主题包含“虐待”，丈夫如何在家里故意让煤气灯缓慢变暗，同时又假装什么都没有改变，目的是使妻子怀疑自己的看法；他还在封闭的阁楼中点灯寻找被他谋杀的女人的珠宝，他搜寻时会发出很大的声音，包括自言自语的声音。妻子一再要求丈夫确认她对调暗的灯光、噪音等声音的感知，但他刻意忽视妻子提及的现实，一直坚持表示灯光没有改变，而是妻子发疯[6]:8；丈夫打算借此将妻子送进精神病院，之后他将能够获得对她的授权书，并可以更有效地进行搜索。
自从1960年代以来，“煤气灯下”一词被广泛用于描述操纵某人对现实感知的努力[7]；1970年代至今，该术语已经被文学用以描述这种行为心理分析[8]。在1980年所出版关于儿童性虐待的书籍中，弗洛伦斯·拉什根据该剧对乔治·丘克（George Cukor）的 《煤气灯》（Gaslight，1944）进行总结写道：“即使在今天，‘煤气灯’一词也用来描述企图破坏他人对现实的看法。”[9]。

特点[编辑]
煤气灯效应涉及一个或一组加害者，以及至少第二个人（受害者），可以是有意识也可以是无意识，并且是秘密进行的，因此所产生的情感虐待不会被公开[10]。
煤气灯效应取决于“首先说服受害者的想法是被歪曲的，其次说服受害者所接受来自加害者的想法是正确和真实的”[1]:45。煤气灯效应在受害者中引起认知失调，通常是充满情感的认知失调[11]，并使受害者对自己的思维、感知和现实检验提出质疑，从而容易引起他们的自尊低落、令人不安的想法和影响，并可能促进混乱、焦虑以及抑郁，在某些情况下甚至导致思觉失调:33–34。当受害者对自己的心理能力失去信心并发展出一种“习得性失助”之后[12]，他们就更容易受到加害者控制:34，而受害者往往是权力和地位较低者[13]:7。 
加害者或受害者的角色可以在给定的关系中摇摆，并且通常每个参与者都确信自己是受害者[14]。当一群人充当加害者时，煤气灯效应会通过该小组成员“微小、通常看不见的行动，通过积累和加强力量而对其造成损害”[15]，个人和团体已将煤气灯效应用于“对其他个人和团体的心理功能进行人际和社会控制”[1]:6。
认知偏差是指听者主要由于某样事物被频繁重复而开始相信它的一种现象。在煤气灯效应期间，该现象可能会发生于受害者身上[12]。

精神分析的解释[编辑]
心理分析学家维克多·卡莱夫（Victor Calef）和爱德华·温斯赫尔（Edward Weinshel）在1981年的一篇文章中指出，煤气灯效应涉及从施害者到受害者心理内容的投射和注入（“转移”）[14]，心理内容则包括情感、知觉、冲动、抵抗、幻想、妄想以及冲突。作者探讨受害者为何可能“倾向于融合并吸收他人将其外部化后投射到他们身上的东西”的多种原因，并得出结论认为，煤气灯效应可能是“一种非常复杂的高度结构化配置，其中包含许多精神因素的贡献”。 
后来，精神病医生西奥多·多帕特（Theodore Dorpat）将此种受害者无意识心理内容的“转移”描述为“投射性认同​（英语）”的一个例子[16][1]:5–6, 40。在受害者并未意识到自己正受到煤气灯效应影响时，投射性认同对其最有效，若受害者自身也认同“转移”的内容（所投射的内容），则它将具有破坏性；但是，当受害人变得能够不相信且不认同投射性认同所产生的负面内投时，这些影响就会被抵消。

人格障碍[编辑]
社交变态者和自恋者[17]经常使用煤气灯效应来虐待和破坏受害者的心理认知。社会变态者一贯违背社会道德规范，违反法律并利用他人，且通常也是令人信服的说谎者，有时甚至是迷人的说谎者，他们始终否认有不法行为；因此，一些受到社会变态者伤害的人可能会怀疑自己的看法[18]。一些虐待配偶身体的人可能断然否认自己曾行使暴力，从而对伴侣产生煤气灯效果[2]；煤气灯效应也可以在亲子关系中发生，其中父母、子女或双方说谎并试图破坏对方的心理知觉[19]。

精神病学[编辑]
在精神病人的住院设施中，患者与工作人员之间发现煤气灯效应现象[20]。Dorpat在1996年的一本书中表示，“煤气灯效应和其他人际关系控制方法被心理健康领域专业人士以及其他人广泛使用”，因为它们是塑造他人行为的有效方法[1]:45；他另表示，临床医生使用具有威权主义态度的人际控制的秘密方法，例如煤气灯效应:xiii–xxi，他也建议临床医生采取更多非指导性和平等主义的态度和方法:225，“将患者视为积极的合作者和平等伙伴”:246。

浪漫关系[编辑]
在人际关系中，加害者“需要是正确的”，以便“保留（自己的）自我意识”和“（自己）在世界上拥有权力的意识”；受害者允许加害者“定义（自身的）现实感”，以至于受害者将对方“理想化”并“寻求（对方的）认可”[6]:3。心理操纵可包括使受害者质疑自己的记忆、知觉和理智，加害者可能会使用轻蔑的语言无效化 (invalidate) 受害者的感受，比如：“你疯了。别那么敏感。不要偏执。我只是在开玩笑！我很担心；我认为你身体不好。”等[3]。 
心理学家吉尔·罗杰斯（Jill Rogers）和黛安·弗林斯塔德（ Diane Follingstad）表示，这种忽视可能会对心理健康产生不利影响。他们将心理虐待描述为：“通过胁迫、控制、口头虐待、监视、孤立、威胁、嫉妒、屈辱、操纵、劣等对待、创造敌对环境，在性和忠诚方面伤害伴侣，在情感上和/或身体上对伴侣有所隐瞒等做法，以伤害他人的一系列令人厌恶的行为。”[21]。在一些婚姻不忠的案例中，人们发现煤气灯效应现象：“治疗师可能通过错误地标记受害者的反应加剧受害者的痛苦。配偶的煤气灯行为可能导致某些受害者产生‘神经衰弱’甚至在某些最恶劣的情况下自杀。”[19][22]。
心理学家格特鲁德·泽蒙·加斯和威廉·尼科尔斯在其1988年的文章〈煤气灯效应：婚姻综合症〉中研究男人的婚外情及其对妻子的影响[22]，他们描述一个男人如何试图说服妻子她在捕风捉影，而不是承认自己有外遇：“一个妻子在自己家里接电话，却在不经意间偷听到丈夫在出差途中和女友幽会的计划。”，丈夫质疑她的感知证据加以否认：“我没有和任何女友通电话。你一定在做梦。”。 
罗杰斯（Rogers）和弗林斯坦德（Follingstand）考察女性的心理虐待经历，这些经历可以作为抑郁、焦虑、躯体化、自杀意念和生活功能的症状以及临床水平的预测指标。他们得出结论，心理虐待会影响妇女的心理健康状态，但是与实体的虐待相比，人们感知到的性格、关系模式和反应方式的负面变化是心理健康结果的更有效指标[21]。心理治疗师斯蒂芬妮·莫尔顿·萨基斯（Stephanie Moulton Sarkis）解释说，“保持一定程度的认知失调才能与煤气灯效应的使用者保持连结”，而在这种情况下，“解决认知失调的最健康方法”涉及“让自己离开或远离操纵煤气灯效应的人”[13]:24–25。 

标志和方法[编辑]
如帕特里夏·埃文斯（Patricia Evans）所述，观察到的施虐者有七个“警告标志”：[23]

向受害者的隐瞒讯息；
反击讯息以符合施虐者的观点；
冷处理讯息；
经常以玩笑的形式进行口头虐待；
阻止和转移受害者对外界的关注；
轻描淡写（“最小化”）受害者的价值；
通过逐渐削弱受害者及其思维过程来破坏受害者心理认知。
埃文斯（Evans）认为有必要了解这些警告标志，以便从该处开始治疗过程[23]。
心理学家埃里诺·格林伯格（Elinor Greenberg）描述三种常见的煤气灯效应方法：[17]

隐藏。虐待者可能向受害者隐瞒或掩盖他们所做的事情。虐待者不会感到羞耻，反而会说服受害者怀疑自己对情况的看法，并把责任归咎于自己。
不断变化。滥用者感到有必要改变受害者的某些东西。无论是受害者的着装或行为方式，他们都希望受害者融入自己的幻想中。如果受害者不遵守，虐待者可能会说服受害者认为自己实际上还不够好。
关系中的控制。虐待者可能希望完全控制受害者并对其拥有控制权。在这种情况下，施虐者会试图将他们与其他朋友和家人隔离开来，以便只有他们才能影响受害者的思想和行为。虐待者享受受害者完全受自己控制的权力感和控制感。
离婚程序教练林赛·埃里森（Lindsey Ellison）所描述的施虐者的最终目标是让受害者重新考量自己的选择并质疑自己的理智，使他们更加依赖施虐者[24]，当中用来降低受害者自尊心的一种策略是施虐者在无视和照顾受害者之间交替，从而使受害者降低对情感的期望，并认为自己不值得他人付出感情[查证请求]。

性别角色[编辑]
心理治疗师斯蒂芬妮·莫尔顿·萨基斯观察发现，煤气灯效应存在于她所治疗的约30至40％的夫妻中，她说：“男性和女性有同样的可能性进行煤气灯效应”[25]，并表示：“据我们所知，性别在这里同等地表现出来。”[13]:27；她进一步解释，我们倾向于认为使用煤气灯效应的是男性居多，因为“男人往往更不愿意（也许是不好意思）与他人谈及女性伴侣的情感虐待”。:27
社会学家佩奇·斯威特（Paige Sweet）在社会不平等和举足轻重的家庭暴力亲密关系背景下研究煤气灯效应认为，“这种策略是性别化的，因为它们依赖于女性气质与非理性的联系。”[26]。
根据哲学教授凯特·艾布拉姆森（Kate Abramson）的观点，煤气灯效应的行为与性别歧视并没有特别的联系，尽管与男性相比，女性往往更经常成为受煤气灯效应影响的对象[3]。艾布拉姆森对此解释认为，这是社会条件的结果，并说：“这是性别歧视结构的一部分，认为女性比男性更没自信，对我们自身所抱持的观点、信念、反应和看法的怀疑程度要高于男性。而煤气灯效应旨在破坏某人的观点、信念、反应和看法。各种形式自我怀疑的性别歧视规范导致我们更易于出现此情形。”艾布拉姆森说，煤气灯效应的最后“阶段”是严重的临床抑郁症。哲学教授希尔德·林德曼（Hilde Lindemann）特别在谈及妇女时表示，在这种情况下，受害者抵抗操纵的能力取决于“她相信自身判断的能力”，建立心理认知的“对抗区”可以帮助受害者重新获得“普通水平的自由性”[27]。

政治事务[编辑]
专栏作家莫琳·道德（Maureen Dowd）是最早在政治背景下使用该术语的人之一[28]，她描述比尔·克林顿政府使用这项技术使纽特·金里奇受到小侮辱的意图，目的是激怒他向公众提出“歇斯底里”的投诉[29][30]。 
心理学家布莱恩特·韦尔奇（Bryant Welch）在其2008年的《混乱状态：政治操纵与对美国思想的攻击》一书中，描述该技术在现代传播时代开始在美国政治中的普遍性。 
记者弗里达·吉蒂斯（Frida Ghitis）用“点燃汽油”一词形容俄罗斯的全球关系。在俄罗斯特工活跃在克里米亚的同时，俄罗斯官员不断否认相关人员的存在，并操纵对政治团体的不信任来支持他们。[31]
《纽约时报杂志》，BBC和《青少年时尚》杂志的记者以及心理学家布莱恩特·韦尔奇、罗伯特·费尔德曼和莉亚·麦克艾拉斯都描述唐纳德·特朗普在2016年美国总统大选期间的某些行为以及他担任总统期间的举动[29][32][33][34][35]。新闻学教授本·雅格达（Ben Yagoda）在2017年1月《高等教育纪事报》中写道，由于特朗普的举动，“加油”一词再次成为热门话题，他说特朗普的“习惯性倾向说‘X’，接着在往后的某个日子里愤愤不平。”并声明“我没有说‘X’。实际上，我永远也不会梦想说‘X’”，为该术语带来新的注解[28]。
此外，宗派团体的领导者和追随者利用煤气灯效应以确保整合任何可能偏离团体的成员[36]。

工作职场[编辑]
当人们做的事情导致同事对自己及其行为提出质疑，而这对当事人的职业表现评价有所损害时，便会在工作场所引起人们关注[37]；受害者在此情境中可能被排除在任职场域的讨论外，成为他人讨论的流言蜚语，长期受到抹黑或质疑导致其信心遭破坏，施害者可能会将相关谈话转移到感知到的错误上[38]。任何人都可以操纵煤气灯效应，当施害者拥有权力时将特别有害[39]。

流行文化[编辑]
流行乐队Steely Dan在其2000年发行的专辑“ Two Against Nature ”中演唱一首名为“ Gaslighting Abbie”的歌曲。
2016年的神秘和心理惊悚片《列车上的女孩》（The Girl on the Train）探索了乘汽油对主角雷切尔（Rachel）的直接影响[29]，曾身为暴力虐待者的瑞秋前夫汤姆是受害者。雷切尔患有严重的抑郁症并且会酗酒，当蕾切尔喝醉时，他总是告诉瑞秋，她做了一些她不记得的可怕事情[40]。 
煤气灯效应是英国广播公司广播电视剧《弓箭手》中2016年情节的主题。这个故事描述海伦·阿切尔（Helen Archer）的伴侣和后来的丈夫罗布·蒂切纳（Rob Titchener）在两年期间对他们的情感虐待，引起公众对该现象的广泛讨论[41]。
在2018年的几个月中，煤气灯效应是NBC电视剧《我们的生活》中的主要情节。剧中角色加比·埃尔南德斯（Gabi Hernandez）在加比因谋杀阿比盖尔（Abigail）在该系列中所犯下的罪行而陷害后，向她最好的朋友阿比盖尔（Abigail Deveroux）放火[42]。 
2020年3月，Dixie Chicks发行一首名为“ Gaslighter ”的歌曲，这是他们即将发行的专辑Gaslighter的主打曲目，歌曲中提到“gaslighting”一词[43]，其灵感来自于主唱娜塔莉·缅因与丈夫演员阿德里安·帕斯达尔（Adrian Pasdar）离婚[44]。

005. 自从1960年代以来，“煤气灯下”一词被广泛用于描述操纵某人对现实感知的努力[7]；1970年代至今，该术语已经被文学用以描述这种行为心理分析[8]。在1980年所出版关于儿童性虐待的书籍中，弗洛伦斯·拉什根据该剧对乔治·丘克（George Cukor）的 《煤气灯》（Gaslight，1944）进行总结写道：“即使在今天，‘煤气灯’一词也用来描述企图破坏他人对现实的看法。”[9]。

006. 煤气灯效应涉及一个或一组加害者，以及至少第二个人（受害者），可以是有意识也可以是无意识，并且是秘密进行的，因此所产生的情感虐待不会被公开[10]。
煤气灯效应取决于“首先说服受害者的想法是被歪曲的，其次说服受害者所接受来自加害者的想法是正确和真实的”[1]:45。煤气灯效应在受害者中引起认知失调，通常是充满情感的认知失调[11]，并使受害者对自己的思维、感知和现实检验提出质疑，从而容易引起他们的自尊低落、令人不安的想法和影响，并可能促进混乱、焦虑以及抑郁，在某些情况下甚至导致思觉失调:33–34。当受害者对自己的心理能力失去信心并发展出一种“习得性失助”之后[12]，他们就更容易受到加害者控制:34，而受害者往往是权力和地位较低者[13]:7。 
加害者或受害者的角色可以在给定的关系中摇摆，并且通常每个参与者都确信自己是受害者[14]。当一群人充当加害者时，煤气灯效应会通过该小组成员“微小、通常看不见的行动，通过积累和加强力量而对其造成损害”[15]，个人和团体已将煤气灯效应用于“对其他个人和团体的心理功能进行人际和社会控制”[1]:6。
认知偏差是指听者主要由于某样事物被频繁重复而开始相信它的一种现象。在煤气灯效应期间，该现象可能会发生于受害者身上[12]。

精神分析的解释[编辑]
心理分析学家维克多·卡莱夫（Victor Calef）和爱德华·温斯赫尔（Edward Weinshel）在1981年的一篇文章中指出，煤气灯效应涉及从施害者到受害者心理内容的投射和注入（“转移”）[14]，心理内容则包括情感、知觉、冲动、抵抗、幻想、妄想以及冲突。作者探讨受害者为何可能“倾向于融合并吸收他人将其外部化后投射到他们身上的东西”的多种原因，并得出结论认为，煤气灯效应可能是“一种非常复杂的高度结构化配置，其中包含许多精神因素的贡献”。 
后来，精神病医生西奥多·多帕特（Theodore Dorpat）将此种受害者无意识心理内容的“转移”描述为“投射性认同​（英语）”的一个例子[16][1]:5–6, 40。在受害者并未意识到自己正受到煤气灯效应影响时，投射性认同对其最有效，若受害者自身也认同“转移”的内容（所投射的内容），则它将具有破坏性；但是，当受害人变得能够不相信且不认同投射性认同所产生的负面内投时，这些影响就会被抵消。

人格障碍[编辑]
社交变态者和自恋者[17]经常使用煤气灯效应来虐待和破坏受害者的心理认知。社会变态者一贯违背社会道德规范，违反法律并利用他人，且通常也是令人信服的说谎者，有时甚至是迷人的说谎者，他们始终否认有不法行为；因此，一些受到社会变态者伤害的人可能会怀疑自己的看法[18]。一些虐待配偶身体的人可能断然否认自己曾行使暴力，从而对伴侣产生煤气灯效果[2]；煤气灯效应也可以在亲子关系中发生，其中父母、子女或双方说谎并试图破坏对方的心理知觉[19]。

精神病学[编辑]
在精神病人的住院设施中，患者与工作人员之间发现煤气灯效应现象[20]。Dorpat在1996年的一本书中表示，“煤气灯效应和其他人际关系控制方法被心理健康领域专业人士以及其他人广泛使用”，因为它们是塑造他人行为的有效方法[1]:45；他另表示，临床医生使用具有威权主义态度的人际控制的秘密方法，例如煤气灯效应:xiii–xxi，他也建议临床医生采取更多非指导性和平等主义的态度和方法:225，“将患者视为积极的合作者和平等伙伴”:246。

浪漫关系[编辑]
在人际关系中，加害者“需要是正确的”，以便“保留（自己的）自我意识”和“（自己）在世界上拥有权力的意识”；受害者允许加害者“定义（自身的）现实感”，以至于受害者将对方“理想化”并“寻求（对方的）认可”[6]:3。心理操纵可包括使受害者质疑自己的记忆、知觉和理智，加害者可能会使用轻蔑的语言无效化 (invalidate) 受害者的感受，比如：“你疯了。别那么敏感。不要偏执。我只是在开玩笑！我很担心；我认为你身体不好。”等[3]。 
心理学家吉尔·罗杰斯（Jill Rogers）和黛安·弗林斯塔德（ Diane Follingstad）表示，这种忽视可能会对心理健康产生不利影响。他们将心理虐待描述为：“通过胁迫、控制、口头虐待、监视、孤立、威胁、嫉妒、屈辱、操纵、劣等对待、创造敌对环境，在性和忠诚方面伤害伴侣，在情感上和/或身体上对伴侣有所隐瞒等做法，以伤害他人的一系列令人厌恶的行为。”[21]。在一些婚姻不忠的案例中，人们发现煤气灯效应现象：“治疗师可能通过错误地标记受害者的反应加剧受害者的痛苦。配偶的煤气灯行为可能导致某些受害者产生‘神经衰弱’甚至在某些最恶劣的情况下自杀。”[19][22]。
心理学家格特鲁德·泽蒙·加斯和威廉·尼科尔斯在其1988年的文章〈煤气灯效应：婚姻综合症〉中研究男人的婚外情及其对妻子的影响[22]，他们描述一个男人如何试图说服妻子她在捕风捉影，而不是承认自己有外遇：“一个妻子在自己家里接电话，却在不经意间偷听到丈夫在出差途中和女友幽会的计划。”，丈夫质疑她的感知证据加以否认：“我没有和任何女友通电话。你一定在做梦。”。 
罗杰斯（Rogers）和弗林斯坦德（Follingstand）考察女性的心理虐待经历，这些经历可以作为抑郁、焦虑、躯体化、自杀意念和生活功能的症状以及临床水平的预测指标。他们得出结论，心理虐待会影响妇女的心理健康状态，但是与实体的虐待相比，人们感知到的性格、关系模式和反应方式的负面变化是心理健康结果的更有效指标[21]。心理治疗师斯蒂芬妮·莫尔顿·萨基斯（Stephanie Moulton Sarkis）解释说，“保持一定程度的认知失调才能与煤气灯效应的使用者保持连结”，而在这种情况下，“解决认知失调的最健康方法”涉及“让自己离开或远离操纵煤气灯效应的人”[13]:24–25。 

标志和方法[编辑]
如帕特里夏·埃文斯（Patricia Evans）所述，观察到的施虐者有七个“警告标志”：[23]

向受害者的隐瞒讯息；
反击讯息以符合施虐者的观点；
冷处理讯息；
经常以玩笑的形式进行口头虐待；
阻止和转移受害者对外界的关注；
轻描淡写（“最小化”）受害者的价值；
通过逐渐削弱受害者及其思维过程来破坏受害者心理认知。
埃文斯（Evans）认为有必要了解这些警告标志，以便从该处开始治疗过程[23]。
心理学家埃里诺·格林伯格（Elinor Greenberg）描述三种常见的煤气灯效应方法：[17]

隐藏。虐待者可能向受害者隐瞒或掩盖他们所做的事情。虐待者不会感到羞耻，反而会说服受害者怀疑自己对情况的看法，并把责任归咎于自己。
不断变化。滥用者感到有必要改变受害者的某些东西。无论是受害者的着装或行为方式，他们都希望受害者融入自己的幻想中。如果受害者不遵守，虐待者可能会说服受害者认为自己实际上还不够好。
关系中的控制。虐待者可能希望完全控制受害者并对其拥有控制权。在这种情况下，施虐者会试图将他们与其他朋友和家人隔离开来，以便只有他们才能影响受害者的思想和行为。虐待者享受受害者完全受自己控制的权力感和控制感。
离婚程序教练林赛·埃里森（Lindsey Ellison）所描述的施虐者的最终目标是让受害者重新考量自己的选择并质疑自己的理智，使他们更加依赖施虐者[24]，当中用来降低受害者自尊心的一种策略是施虐者在无视和照顾受害者之间交替，从而使受害者降低对情感的期望，并认为自己不值得他人付出感情[查证请求]。

性别角色[编辑]
心理治疗师斯蒂芬妮·莫尔顿·萨基斯观察发现，煤气灯效应存在于她所治疗的约30至40％的夫妻中，她说：“男性和女性有同样的可能性进行煤气灯效应”[25]，并表示：“据我们所知，性别在这里同等地表现出来。”[13]:27；她进一步解释，我们倾向于认为使用煤气灯效应的是男性居多，因为“男人往往更不愿意（也许是不好意思）与他人谈及女性伴侣的情感虐待”。:27
社会学家佩奇·斯威特（Paige Sweet）在社会不平等和举足轻重的家庭暴力亲密关系背景下研究煤气灯效应认为，“这种策略是性别化的，因为它们依赖于女性气质与非理性的联系。”[26]。
根据哲学教授凯特·艾布拉姆森（Kate Abramson）的观点，煤气灯效应的行为与性别歧视并没有特别的联系，尽管与男性相比，女性往往更经常成为受煤气灯效应影响的对象[3]。艾布拉姆森对此解释认为，这是社会条件的结果，并说：“这是性别歧视结构的一部分，认为女性比男性更没自信，对我们自身所抱持的观点、信念、反应和看法的怀疑程度要高于男性。而煤气灯效应旨在破坏某人的观点、信念、反应和看法。各种形式自我怀疑的性别歧视规范导致我们更易于出现此情形。”艾布拉姆森说，煤气灯效应的最后“阶段”是严重的临床抑郁症。哲学教授希尔德·林德曼（Hilde Lindemann）特别在谈及妇女时表示，在这种情况下，受害者抵抗操纵的能力取决于“她相信自身判断的能力”，建立心理认知的“对抗区”可以帮助受害者重新获得“普通水平的自由性”[27]。

政治事务[编辑]
专栏作家莫琳·道德（Maureen Dowd）是最早在政治背景下使用该术语的人之一[28]，她描述比尔·克林顿政府使用这项技术使纽特·金里奇受到小侮辱的意图，目的是激怒他向公众提出“歇斯底里”的投诉[29][30]。 
心理学家布莱恩特·韦尔奇（Bryant Welch）在其2008年的《混乱状态：政治操纵与对美国思想的攻击》一书中，描述该技术在现代传播时代开始在美国政治中的普遍性。 
记者弗里达·吉蒂斯（Frida Ghitis）用“点燃汽油”一词形容俄罗斯的全球关系。在俄罗斯特工活跃在克里米亚的同时，俄罗斯官员不断否认相关人员的存在，并操纵对政治团体的不信任来支持他们。[31]
《纽约时报杂志》，BBC和《青少年时尚》杂志的记者以及心理学家布莱恩特·韦尔奇、罗伯特·费尔德曼和莉亚·麦克艾拉斯都描述唐纳德·特朗普在2016年美国总统大选期间的某些行为以及他担任总统期间的举动[29][32][33][34][35]。新闻学教授本·雅格达（Ben Yagoda）在2017年1月《高等教育纪事报》中写道，由于特朗普的举动，“加油”一词再次成为热门话题，他说特朗普的“习惯性倾向说‘X’，接着在往后的某个日子里愤愤不平。”并声明“我没有说‘X’。实际上，我永远也不会梦想说‘X’”，为该术语带来新的注解[28]。
此外，宗派团体的领导者和追随者利用煤气灯效应以确保整合任何可能偏离团体的成员[36]。

工作职场[编辑]
当人们做的事情导致同事对自己及其行为提出质疑，而这对当事人的职业表现评价有所损害时，便会在工作场所引起人们关注[37]；受害者在此情境中可能被排除在任职场域的讨论外，成为他人讨论的流言蜚语，长期受到抹黑或质疑导致其信心遭破坏，施害者可能会将相关谈话转移到感知到的错误上[38]。任何人都可以操纵煤气灯效应，当施害者拥有权力时将特别有害[39]。

流行文化[编辑]
流行乐队Steely Dan在其2000年发行的专辑“ Two Against Nature ”中演唱一首名为“ Gaslighting Abbie”的歌曲。
2016年的神秘和心理惊悚片《列车上的女孩》（The Girl on the Train）探索了乘汽油对主角雷切尔（Rachel）的直接影响[29]，曾身为暴力虐待者的瑞秋前夫汤姆是受害者。雷切尔患有严重的抑郁症并且会酗酒，当蕾切尔喝醉时，他总是告诉瑞秋，她做了一些她不记得的可怕事情[40]。 
煤气灯效应是英国广播公司广播电视剧《弓箭手》中2016年情节的主题。这个故事描述海伦·阿切尔（Helen Archer）的伴侣和后来的丈夫罗布·蒂切纳（Rob Titchener）在两年期间对他们的情感虐待，引起公众对该现象的广泛讨论[41]。
在2018年的几个月中，煤气灯效应是NBC电视剧《我们的生活》中的主要情节。剧中角色加比·埃尔南德斯（Gabi Hernandez）在加比因谋杀阿比盖尔（Abigail）在该系列中所犯下的罪行而陷害后，向她最好的朋友阿比盖尔（Abigail Deveroux）放火[42]。 
2020年3月，Dixie Chicks发行一首名为“ Gaslighter ”的歌曲，这是他们即将发行的专辑Gaslighter的主打曲目，歌曲中提到“gaslighting”一词[43]，其灵感来自于主唱娜塔莉·缅因与丈夫演员阿德里安·帕斯达尔（Adrian Pasdar）离婚[44]。

007. 煤气灯效应取决于“首先说服受害者的想法是被歪曲的，其次说服受害者所接受来自加害者的想法是正确和真实的”[1]:45。煤气灯效应在受害者中引起认知失调，通常是充满情感的认知失调[11]，并使受害者对自己的思维、感知和现实检验提出质疑，从而容易引起他们的自尊低落、令人不安的想法和影响，并可能促进混乱、焦虑以及抑郁，在某些情况下甚至导致思觉失调:33–34。当受害者对自己的心理能力失去信心并发展出一种“习得性失助”之后[12]，他们就更容易受到加害者控制:34，而受害者往往是权力和地位较低者[13]:7。 
加害者或受害者的角色可以在给定的关系中摇摆，并且通常每个参与者都确信自己是受害者[14]。当一群人充当加害者时，煤气灯效应会通过该小组成员“微小、通常看不见的行动，通过积累和加强力量而对其造成损害”[15]，个人和团体已将煤气灯效应用于“对其他个人和团体的心理功能进行人际和社会控制”[1]:6。
认知偏差是指听者主要由于某样事物被频繁重复而开始相信它的一种现象。在煤气灯效应期间，该现象可能会发生于受害者身上[12]。

精神分析的解释[编辑]
心理分析学家维克多·卡莱夫（Victor Calef）和爱德华·温斯赫尔（Edward Weinshel）在1981年的一篇文章中指出，煤气灯效应涉及从施害者到受害者心理内容的投射和注入（“转移”）[14]，心理内容则包括情感、知觉、冲动、抵抗、幻想、妄想以及冲突。作者探讨受害者为何可能“倾向于融合并吸收他人将其外部化后投射到他们身上的东西”的多种原因，并得出结论认为，煤气灯效应可能是“一种非常复杂的高度结构化配置，其中包含许多精神因素的贡献”。 
后来，精神病医生西奥多·多帕特（Theodore Dorpat）将此种受害者无意识心理内容的“转移”描述为“投射性认同​（英语）”的一个例子[16][1]:5–6, 40。在受害者并未意识到自己正受到煤气灯效应影响时，投射性认同对其最有效，若受害者自身也认同“转移”的内容（所投射的内容），则它将具有破坏性；但是，当受害人变得能够不相信且不认同投射性认同所产生的负面内投时，这些影响就会被抵消。

人格障碍[编辑]
社交变态者和自恋者[17]经常使用煤气灯效应来虐待和破坏受害者的心理认知。社会变态者一贯违背社会道德规范，违反法律并利用他人，且通常也是令人信服的说谎者，有时甚至是迷人的说谎者，他们始终否认有不法行为；因此，一些受到社会变态者伤害的人可能会怀疑自己的看法[18]。一些虐待配偶身体的人可能断然否认自己曾行使暴力，从而对伴侣产生煤气灯效果[2]；煤气灯效应也可以在亲子关系中发生，其中父母、子女或双方说谎并试图破坏对方的心理知觉[19]。

在精神病人的住院设施中，患者与工作人员之间发现煤气灯效应现象[20]。Dorpat在1996年的一本书中表示，“煤气灯效应和其他人际关系控制方法被心理健康领域专业人士以及其他人广泛使用”，因为它们是塑造他人行为的有效方法[1]:45；他另表示，临床医生使用具有威权主义态度的人际控制的秘密方法，例如煤气灯效应:xiii–xxi，他也建议临床医生采取更多非指导性和平等主义的态度和方法:225，“将患者视为积极的合作者和平等伙伴”:246。

浪漫关系[编辑]
在人际关系中，加害者“需要是正确的”，以便“保留（自己的）自我意识”和“（自己）在世界上拥有权力的意识”；受害者允许加害者“定义（自身的）现实感”，以至于受害者将对方“理想化”并“寻求（对方的）认可”[6]:3。心理操纵可包括使受害者质疑自己的记忆、知觉和理智，加害者可能会使用轻蔑的语言无效化 (invalidate) 受害者的感受，比如：“你疯了。别那么敏感。不要偏执。我只是在开玩笑！我很担心；我认为你身体不好。”等[3]。 
心理学家吉尔·罗杰斯（Jill Rogers）和黛安·弗林斯塔德（ Diane Follingstad）表示，这种忽视可能会对心理健康产生不利影响。他们将心理虐待描述为：“通过胁迫、控制、口头虐待、监视、孤立、威胁、嫉妒、屈辱、操纵、劣等对待、创造敌对环境，在性和忠诚方面伤害伴侣，在情感上和/或身体上对伴侣有所隐瞒等做法，以伤害他人的一系列令人厌恶的行为。”[21]。在一些婚姻不忠的案例中，人们发现煤气灯效应现象：“治疗师可能通过错误地标记受害者的反应加剧受害者的痛苦。配偶的煤气灯行为可能导致某些受害者产生‘神经衰弱’甚至在某些最恶劣的情况下自杀。”[19][22]。
心理学家格特鲁德·泽蒙·加斯和威廉·尼科尔斯在其1988年的文章〈煤气灯效应：婚姻综合症〉中研究男人的婚外情及其对妻子的影响[22]，他们描述一个男人如何试图说服妻子她在捕风捉影，而不是承认自己有外遇：“一个妻子在自己家里接电话，却在不经意间偷听到丈夫在出差途中和女友幽会的计划。”，丈夫质疑她的感知证据加以否认：“我没有和任何女友通电话。你一定在做梦。”。 
罗杰斯（Rogers）和弗林斯坦德（Follingstand）考察女性的心理虐待经历，这些经历可以作为抑郁、焦虑、躯体化、自杀意念和生活功能的症状以及临床水平的预测指标。他们得出结论，心理虐待会影响妇女的心理健康状态，但是与实体的虐待相比，人们感知到的性格、关系模式和反应方式的负面变化是心理健康结果的更有效指标[21]。心理治疗师斯蒂芬妮·莫尔顿·萨基斯（Stephanie Moulton Sarkis）解释说，“保持一定程度的认知失调才能与煤气灯效应的使用者保持连结”，而在这种情况下，“解决认知失调的最健康方法”涉及“让自己离开或远离操纵煤气灯效应的人”[13]:24–25。 

标志和方法[编辑]
如帕特里夏·埃文斯（Patricia Evans）所述，观察到的施虐者有七个“警告标志”：[23]

向受害者的隐瞒讯息；
反击讯息以符合施虐者的观点；
冷处理讯息；
经常以玩笑的形式进行口头虐待；
阻止和转移受害者对外界的关注；
轻描淡写（“最小化”）受害者的价值；
通过逐渐削弱受害者及其思维过程来破坏受害者心理认知。
埃文斯（Evans）认为有必要了解这些警告标志，以便从该处开始治疗过程[23]。
心理学家埃里诺·格林伯格（Elinor Greenberg）描述三种常见的煤气灯效应方法：[17]

隐藏。虐待者可能向受害者隐瞒或掩盖他们所做的事情。虐待者不会感到羞耻，反而会说服受害者怀疑自己对情况的看法，并把责任归咎于自己。
不断变化。滥用者感到有必要改变受害者的某些东西。无论是受害者的着装或行为方式，他们都希望受害者融入自己的幻想中。如果受害者不遵守，虐待者可能会说服受害者认为自己实际上还不够好。
关系中的控制。虐待者可能希望完全控制受害者并对其拥有控制权。在这种情况下，施虐者会试图将他们与其他朋友和家人隔离开来，以便只有他们才能影响受害者的思想和行为。虐待者享受受害者完全受自己控制的权力感和控制感。
离婚程序教练林赛·埃里森（Lindsey Ellison）所描述的施虐者的最终目标是让受害者重新考量自己的选择并质疑自己的理智，使他们更加依赖施虐者[24]，当中用来降低受害者自尊心的一种策略是施虐者在无视和照顾受害者之间交替，从而使受害者降低对情感的期望，并认为自己不值得他人付出感情[查证请求]。

性别角色[编辑]
心理治疗师斯蒂芬妮·莫尔顿·萨基斯观察发现，煤气灯效应存在于她所治疗的约30至40％的夫妻中，她说：“男性和女性有同样的可能性进行煤气灯效应”[25]，并表示：“据我们所知，性别在这里同等地表现出来。”[13]:27；她进一步解释，我们倾向于认为使用煤气灯效应的是男性居多，因为“男人往往更不愿意（也许是不好意思）与他人谈及女性伴侣的情感虐待”。:27
社会学家佩奇·斯威特（Paige Sweet）在社会不平等和举足轻重的家庭暴力亲密关系背景下研究煤气灯效应认为，“这种策略是性别化的，因为它们依赖于女性气质与非理性的联系。”[26]。
根据哲学教授凯特·艾布拉姆森（Kate Abramson）的观点，煤气灯效应的行为与性别歧视并没有特别的联系，尽管与男性相比，女性往往更经常成为受煤气灯效应影响的对象[3]。艾布拉姆森对此解释认为，这是社会条件的结果，并说：“这是性别歧视结构的一部分，认为女性比男性更没自信，对我们自身所抱持的观点、信念、反应和看法的怀疑程度要高于男性。而煤气灯效应旨在破坏某人的观点、信念、反应和看法。各种形式自我怀疑的性别歧视规范导致我们更易于出现此情形。”艾布拉姆森说，煤气灯效应的最后“阶段”是严重的临床抑郁症。哲学教授希尔德·林德曼（Hilde Lindemann）特别在谈及妇女时表示，在这种情况下，受害者抵抗操纵的能力取决于“她相信自身判断的能力”，建立心理认知的“对抗区”可以帮助受害者重新获得“普通水平的自由性”[27]。

政治事务[编辑]
专栏作家莫琳·道德（Maureen Dowd）是最早在政治背景下使用该术语的人之一[28]，她描述比尔·克林顿政府使用这项技术使纽特·金里奇受到小侮辱的意图，目的是激怒他向公众提出“歇斯底里”的投诉[29][30]。 
心理学家布莱恩特·韦尔奇（Bryant Welch）在其2008年的《混乱状态：政治操纵与对美国思想的攻击》一书中，描述该技术在现代传播时代开始在美国政治中的普遍性。 
记者弗里达·吉蒂斯（Frida Ghitis）用“点燃汽油”一词形容俄罗斯的全球关系。在俄罗斯特工活跃在克里米亚的同时，俄罗斯官员不断否认相关人员的存在，并操纵对政治团体的不信任来支持他们。[31]
《纽约时报杂志》，BBC和《青少年时尚》杂志的记者以及心理学家布莱恩特·韦尔奇、罗伯特·费尔德曼和莉亚·麦克艾拉斯都描述唐纳德·特朗普在2016年美国总统大选期间的某些行为以及他担任总统期间的举动[29][32][33][34][35]。新闻学教授本·雅格达（Ben Yagoda）在2017年1月《高等教育纪事报》中写道，由于特朗普的举动，“加油”一词再次成为热门话题，他说特朗普的“习惯性倾向说‘X’，接着在往后的某个日子里愤愤不平。”并声明“我没有说‘X’。实际上，我永远也不会梦想说‘X’”，为该术语带来新的注解[28]。
此外，宗派团体的领导者和追随者利用煤气灯效应以确保整合任何可能偏离团体的成员[36]。

工作职场[编辑]
当人们做的事情导致同事对自己及其行为提出质疑，而这对当事人的职业表现评价有所损害时，便会在工作场所引起人们关注[37]；受害者在此情境中可能被排除在任职场域的讨论外，成为他人讨论的流言蜚语，长期受到抹黑或质疑导致其信心遭破坏，施害者可能会将相关谈话转移到感知到的错误上[38]。任何人都可以操纵煤气灯效应，当施害者拥有权力时将特别有害[39]。

流行文化[编辑]
流行乐队Steely Dan在其2000年发行的专辑“ Two Against Nature ”中演唱一首名为“ Gaslighting Abbie”的歌曲。
2016年的神秘和心理惊悚片《列车上的女孩》（The Girl on the Train）探索了乘汽油对主角雷切尔（Rachel）的直接影响[29]，曾身为暴力虐待者的瑞秋前夫汤姆是受害者。雷切尔患有严重的抑郁症并且会酗酒，当蕾切尔喝醉时，他总是告诉瑞秋，她做了一些她不记得的可怕事情[40]。 
煤气灯效应是英国广播公司广播电视剧《弓箭手》中2016年情节的主题。这个故事描述海伦·阿切尔（Helen Archer）的伴侣和后来的丈夫罗布·蒂切纳（Rob Titchener）在两年期间对他们的情感虐待，引起公众对该现象的广泛讨论[41]。
在2018年的几个月中，煤气灯效应是NBC电视剧《我们的生活》中的主要情节。剧中角色加比·埃尔南德斯（Gabi Hernandez）在加比因谋杀阿比盖尔（Abigail）在该系列中所犯下的罪行而陷害后，向她最好的朋友阿比盖尔（Abigail Deveroux）放火[42]。 
2020年3月，Dixie Chicks发行一首名为“ Gaslighter ”的歌曲，这是他们即将发行的专辑Gaslighter的主打曲目，歌曲中提到“gaslighting”一词[43]，其灵感来自于主唱娜塔莉·缅因与丈夫演员阿德里安·帕斯达尔（Adrian Pasdar）离婚[44]。

008. 加害者或受害者的角色可以在给定的关系中摇摆，并且通常每个参与者都确信自己是受害者[14]。当一群人充当加害者时，煤气灯效应会通过该小组成员“微小、通常看不见的行动，通过积累和加强力量而对其造成损害”[15]，个人和团体已将煤气灯效应用于“对其他个人和团体的心理功能进行人际和社会控制”[1]:6。
认知偏差是指听者主要由于某样事物被频繁重复而开始相信它的一种现象。在煤气灯效应期间，该现象可能会发生于受害者身上[12]。

精神分析的解释[编辑]
心理分析学家维克多·卡莱夫（Victor Calef）和爱德华·温斯赫尔（Edward Weinshel）在1981年的一篇文章中指出，煤气灯效应涉及从施害者到受害者心理内容的投射和注入（“转移”）[14]，心理内容则包括情感、知觉、冲动、抵抗、幻想、妄想以及冲突。作者探讨受害者为何可能“倾向于融合并吸收他人将其外部化后投射到他们身上的东西”的多种原因，并得出结论认为，煤气灯效应可能是“一种非常复杂的高度结构化配置，其中包含许多精神因素的贡献”。 
后来，精神病医生西奥多·多帕特（Theodore Dorpat）将此种受害者无意识心理内容的“转移”描述为“投射性认同​（英语）”的一个例子[16][1]:5–6, 40。在受害者并未意识到自己正受到煤气灯效应影响时，投射性认同对其最有效，若受害者自身也认同“转移”的内容（所投射的内容），则它将具有破坏性；但是，当受害人变得能够不相信且不认同投射性认同所产生的负面内投时，这些影响就会被抵消。

人格障碍[编辑]
社交变态者和自恋者[17]经常使用煤气灯效应来虐待和破坏受害者的心理认知。社会变态者一贯违背社会道德规范，违反法律并利用他人，且通常也是令人信服的说谎者，有时甚至是迷人的说谎者，他们始终否认有不法行为；因此，一些受到社会变态者伤害的人可能会怀疑自己的看法[18]。一些虐待配偶身体的人可能断然否认自己曾行使暴力，从而对伴侣产生煤气灯效果[2]；煤气灯效应也可以在亲子关系中发生，其中父母、子女或双方说谎并试图破坏对方的心理知觉[19]。

精神病学[编辑]
在精神病人的住院设施中，患者与工作人员之间发现煤气灯效应现象[20]。Dorpat在1996年的一本书中表示，“煤气灯效应和其他人际关系控制方法被心理健康领域专业人士以及其他人广泛使用”，因为它们是塑造他人行为的有效方法[1]:45；他另表示，临床医生使用具有威权主义态度的人际控制的秘密方法，例如煤气灯效应:xiii–xxi，他也建议临床医生采取更多非指导性和平等主义的态度和方法:225，“将患者视为积极的合作者和平等伙伴”:246。

浪漫关系[编辑]
在人际关系中，加害者“需要是正确的”，以便“保留（自己的）自我意识”和“（自己）在世界上拥有权力的意识”；受害者允许加害者“定义（自身的）现实感”，以至于受害者将对方“理想化”并“寻求（对方的）认可”[6]:3。心理操纵可包括使受害者质疑自己的记忆、知觉和理智，加害者可能会使用轻蔑的语言无效化 (invalidate) 受害者的感受，比如：“你疯了。别那么敏感。不要偏执。我只是在开玩笑！我很担心；我认为你身体不好。”等[3]。 
心理学家吉尔·罗杰斯（Jill Rogers）和黛安·弗林斯塔德（ Diane Follingstad）表示，这种忽视可能会对心理健康产生不利影响。他们将心理虐待描述为：“通过胁迫、控制、口头虐待、监视、孤立、威胁、嫉妒、屈辱、操纵、劣等对待、创造敌对环境，在性和忠诚方面伤害伴侣，在情感上和/或身体上对伴侣有所隐瞒等做法，以伤害他人的一系列令人厌恶的行为。”[21]。在一些婚姻不忠的案例中，人们发现煤气灯效应现象：“治疗师可能通过错误地标记受害者的反应加剧受害者的痛苦。配偶的煤气灯行为可能导致某些受害者产生‘神经衰弱’甚至在某些最恶劣的情况下自杀。”[19][22]。
心理学家格特鲁德·泽蒙·加斯和威廉·尼科尔斯在其1988年的文章〈煤气灯效应：婚姻综合症〉中研究男人的婚外情及其对妻子的影响[22]，他们描述一个男人如何试图说服妻子她在捕风捉影，而不是承认自己有外遇：“一个妻子在自己家里接电话，却在不经意间偷听到丈夫在出差途中和女友幽会的计划。”，丈夫质疑她的感知证据加以否认：“我没有和任何女友通电话。你一定在做梦。”。 
罗杰斯（Rogers）和弗林斯坦德（Follingstand）考察女性的心理虐待经历，这些经历可以作为抑郁、焦虑、躯体化、自杀意念和生活功能的症状以及临床水平的预测指标。他们得出结论，心理虐待会影响妇女的心理健康状态，但是与实体的虐待相比，人们感知到的性格、关系模式和反应方式的负面变化是心理健康结果的更有效指标[21]。心理治疗师斯蒂芬妮·莫尔顿·萨基斯（Stephanie Moulton Sarkis）解释说，“保持一定程度的认知失调才能与煤气灯效应的使用者保持连结”，而在这种情况下，“解决认知失调的最健康方法”涉及“让自己离开或远离操纵煤气灯效应的人”[13]:24–25。 

标志和方法[编辑]
如帕特里夏·埃文斯（Patricia Evans）所述，观察到的施虐者有七个“警告标志”：[23]

向受害者的隐瞒讯息；
反击讯息以符合施虐者的观点；
冷处理讯息；
经常以玩笑的形式进行口头虐待；
阻止和转移受害者对外界的关注；
轻描淡写（“最小化”）受害者的价值；
通过逐渐削弱受害者及其思维过程来破坏受害者心理认知。
埃文斯（Evans）认为有必要了解这些警告标志，以便从该处开始治疗过程[23]。
心理学家埃里诺·格林伯格（Elinor Greenberg）描述三种常见的煤气灯效应方法：[17]

隐藏。虐待者可能向受害者隐瞒或掩盖他们所做的事情。虐待者不会感到羞耻，反而会说服受害者怀疑自己对情况的看法，并把责任归咎于自己。
不断变化。滥用者感到有必要改变受害者的某些东西。无论是受害者的着装或行为方式，他们都希望受害者融入自己的幻想中。如果受害者不遵守，虐待者可能会说服受害者认为自己实际上还不够好。
关系中的控制。虐待者可能希望完全控制受害者并对其拥有控制权。在这种情况下，施虐者会试图将他们与其他朋友和家人隔离开来，以便只有他们才能影响受害者的思想和行为。虐待者享受受害者完全受自己控制的权力感和控制感。
离婚程序教练林赛·埃里森（Lindsey Ellison）所描述的施虐者的最终目标是让受害者重新考量自己的选择并质疑自己的理智，使他们更加依赖施虐者[24]，当中用来降低受害者自尊心的一种策略是施虐者在无视和照顾受害者之间交替，从而使受害者降低对情感的期望，并认为自己不值得他人付出感情[查证请求]。

性别角色[编辑]
心理治疗师斯蒂芬妮·莫尔顿·萨基斯观察发现，煤气灯效应存在于她所治疗的约30至40％的夫妻中，她说：“男性和女性有同样的可能性进行煤气灯效应”[25]，并表示：“据我们所知，性别在这里同等地表现出来。”[13]:27；她进一步解释，我们倾向于认为使用煤气灯效应的是男性居多，因为“男人往往更不愿意（也许是不好意思）与他人谈及女性伴侣的情感虐待”。:27
社会学家佩奇·斯威特（Paige Sweet）在社会不平等和举足轻重的家庭暴力亲密关系背景下研究煤气灯效应认为，“这种策略是性别化的，因为它们依赖于女性气质与非理性的联系。”[26]。
根据哲学教授凯特·艾布拉姆森（Kate Abramson）的观点，煤气灯效应的行为与性别歧视并没有特别的联系，尽管与男性相比，女性往往更经常成为受煤气灯效应影响的对象[3]。艾布拉姆森对此解释认为，这是社会条件的结果，并说：“这是性别歧视结构的一部分，认为女性比男性更没自信，对我们自身所抱持的观点、信念、反应和看法的怀疑程度要高于男性。而煤气灯效应旨在破坏某人的观点、信念、反应和看法。各种形式自我怀疑的性别歧视规范导致我们更易于出现此情形。”艾布拉姆森说，煤气灯效应的最后“阶段”是严重的临床抑郁症。哲学教授希尔德·林德曼（Hilde Lindemann）特别在谈及妇女时表示，在这种情况下，受害者抵抗操纵的能力取决于“她相信自身判断的能力”，建立心理认知的“对抗区”可以帮助受害者重新获得“普通水平的自由性”[27]。

政治事务[编辑]
专栏作家莫琳·道德（Maureen Dowd）是最早在政治背景下使用该术语的人之一[28]，她描述比尔·克林顿政府使用这项技术使纽特·金里奇受到小侮辱的意图，目的是激怒他向公众提出“歇斯底里”的投诉[29][30]。 
心理学家布莱恩特·韦尔奇（Bryant Welch）在其2008年的《混乱状态：政治操纵与对美国思想的攻击》一书中，描述该技术在现代传播时代开始在美国政治中的普遍性。 
记者弗里达·吉蒂斯（Frida Ghitis）用“点燃汽油”一词形容俄罗斯的全球关系。在俄罗斯特工活跃在克里米亚的同时，俄罗斯官员不断否认相关人员的存在，并操纵对政治团体的不信任来支持他们。[31]
《纽约时报杂志》，BBC和《青少年时尚》杂志的记者以及心理学家布莱恩特·韦尔奇、罗伯特·费尔德曼和莉亚·麦克艾拉斯都描述唐纳德·特朗普在2016年美国总统大选期间的某些行为以及他担任总统期间的举动[29][32][33][34][35]。新闻学教授本·雅格达（Ben Yagoda）在2017年1月《高等教育纪事报》中写道，由于特朗普的举动，“加油”一词再次成为热门话题，他说特朗普的“习惯性倾向说‘X’，接着在往后的某个日子里愤愤不平。”并声明“我没有说‘X’。实际上，我永远也不会梦想说‘X’”，为该术语带来新的注解[28]。
此外，宗派团体的领导者和追随者利用煤气灯效应以确保整合任何可能偏离团体的成员[36]。

工作职场[编辑]
当人们做的事情导致同事对自己及其行为提出质疑，而这对当事人的职业表现评价有所损害时，便会在工作场所引起人们关注[37]；受害者在此情境中可能被排除在任职场域的讨论外，成为他人讨论的流言蜚语，长期受到抹黑或质疑导致其信心遭破坏，施害者可能会将相关谈话转移到感知到的错误上[38]。任何人都可以操纵煤气灯效应，当施害者拥有权力时将特别有害[39]。

流行文化[编辑]
流行乐队Steely Dan在其2000年发行的专辑“ Two Against Nature ”中演唱一首名为“ Gaslighting Abbie”的歌曲。
2016年的神秘和心理惊悚片《列车上的女孩》（The Girl on the Train）探索了乘汽油对主角雷切尔（Rachel）的直接影响[29]，曾身为暴力虐待者的瑞秋前夫汤姆是受害者。雷切尔患有严重的抑郁症并且会酗酒，当蕾切尔喝醉时，他总是告诉瑞秋，她做了一些她不记得的可怕事情[40]。 
煤气灯效应是英国广播公司广播电视剧《弓箭手》中2016年情节的主题。这个故事描述海伦·阿切尔（Helen Archer）的伴侣和后来的丈夫罗布·蒂切纳（Rob Titchener）在两年期间对他们的情感虐待，引起公众对该现象的广泛讨论[41]。
在2018年的几个月中，煤气灯效应是NBC电视剧《我们的生活》中的主要情节。剧中角色加比·埃尔南德斯（Gabi Hernandez）在加比因谋杀阿比盖尔（Abigail）在该系列中所犯下的罪行而陷害后，向她最好的朋友阿比盖尔（Abigail Deveroux）放火[42]。 
2020年3月，Dixie Chicks发行一首名为“ Gaslighter ”的歌曲，这是他们即将发行的专辑Gaslighter的主打曲目，歌曲中提到“gaslighting”一词[43]，其灵感来自于主唱娜塔莉·缅因与丈夫演员阿德里安·帕斯达尔（Adrian Pasdar）离婚[44]。

009. 认知偏差是指听者主要由于某样事物被频繁重复而开始相信它的一种现象。在煤气灯效应期间，该现象可能会发生于受害者身上[12]。

010. 精神分析的解释

011. 心理分析学家维克多·卡莱夫（Victor Calef）和爱德华·温斯赫尔（Edward Weinshel）在1981年的一篇文章中指出，煤气灯效应涉及从施害者到受害者心理内容的投射和注入（“转移”）[14]，心理内容则包括情感、知觉、冲动、抵抗、幻想、妄想以及冲突。作者探讨受害者为何可能“倾向于融合并吸收他人将其外部化后投射到他们身上的东西”的多种原因，并得出结论认为，煤气灯效应可能是“一种非常复杂的高度结构化配置，其中包含许多精神因素的贡献”。 
后来，精神病医生西奥多·多帕特（Theodore Dorpat）将此种受害者无意识心理内容的“转移”描述为“投射性认同​（英语）”的一个例子[16][1]:5–6, 40。在受害者并未意识到自己正受到煤气灯效应影响时，投射性认同对其最有效，若受害者自身也认同“转移”的内容（所投射的内容），则它将具有破坏性；但是，当受害人变得能够不相信且不认同投射性认同所产生的负面内投时，这些影响就会被抵消。

人格障碍[编辑]
社交变态者和自恋者[17]经常使用煤气灯效应来虐待和破坏受害者的心理认知。社会变态者一贯违背社会道德规范，违反法律并利用他人，且通常也是令人信服的说谎者，有时甚至是迷人的说谎者，他们始终否认有不法行为；因此，一些受到社会变态者伤害的人可能会怀疑自己的看法[18]。一些虐待配偶身体的人可能断然否认自己曾行使暴力，从而对伴侣产生煤气灯效果[2]；煤气灯效应也可以在亲子关系中发生，其中父母、子女或双方说谎并试图破坏对方的心理知觉[19]。

精神病学[编辑]
在精神病人的住院设施中，患者与工作人员之间发现煤气灯效应现象[20]。Dorpat在1996年的一本书中表示，“煤气灯效应和其他人际关系控制方法被心理健康领域专业人士以及其他人广泛使用”，因为它们是塑造他人行为的有效方法[1]:45；他另表示，临床医生使用具有威权主义态度的人际控制的秘密方法，例如煤气灯效应:xiii–xxi，他也建议临床医生采取更多非指导性和平等主义的态度和方法:225，“将患者视为积极的合作者和平等伙伴”:246。

浪漫关系[编辑]
在人际关系中，加害者“需要是正确的”，以便“保留（自己的）自我意识”和“（自己）在世界上拥有权力的意识”；受害者允许加害者“定义（自身的）现实感”，以至于受害者将对方“理想化”并“寻求（对方的）认可”[6]:3。心理操纵可包括使受害者质疑自己的记忆、知觉和理智，加害者可能会使用轻蔑的语言无效化 (invalidate) 受害者的感受，比如：“你疯了。别那么敏感。不要偏执。我只是在开玩笑！我很担心；我认为你身体不好。”等[3]。 
心理学家吉尔·罗杰斯（Jill Rogers）和黛安·弗林斯塔德（ Diane Follingstad）表示，这种忽视可能会对心理健康产生不利影响。他们将心理虐待描述为：“通过胁迫、控制、口头虐待、监视、孤立、威胁、嫉妒、屈辱、操纵、劣等对待、创造敌对环境，在性和忠诚方面伤害伴侣，在情感上和/或身体上对伴侣有所隐瞒等做法，以伤害他人的一系列令人厌恶的行为。”[21]。在一些婚姻不忠的案例中，人们发现煤气灯效应现象：“治疗师可能通过错误地标记受害者的反应加剧受害者的痛苦。配偶的煤气灯行为可能导致某些受害者产生‘神经衰弱’甚至在某些最恶劣的情况下自杀。”[19][22]。
心理学家格特鲁德·泽蒙·加斯和威廉·尼科尔斯在其1988年的文章〈煤气灯效应：婚姻综合症〉中研究男人的婚外情及其对妻子的影响[22]，他们描述一个男人如何试图说服妻子她在捕风捉影，而不是承认自己有外遇：“一个妻子在自己家里接电话，却在不经意间偷听到丈夫在出差途中和女友幽会的计划。”，丈夫质疑她的感知证据加以否认：“我没有和任何女友通电话。你一定在做梦。”。 
罗杰斯（Rogers）和弗林斯坦德（Follingstand）考察女性的心理虐待经历，这些经历可以作为抑郁、焦虑、躯体化、自杀意念和生活功能的症状以及临床水平的预测指标。他们得出结论，心理虐待会影响妇女的心理健康状态，但是与实体的虐待相比，人们感知到的性格、关系模式和反应方式的负面变化是心理健康结果的更有效指标[21]。心理治疗师斯蒂芬妮·莫尔顿·萨基斯（Stephanie Moulton Sarkis）解释说，“保持一定程度的认知失调才能与煤气灯效应的使用者保持连结”，而在这种情况下，“解决认知失调的最健康方法”涉及“让自己离开或远离操纵煤气灯效应的人”[13]:24–25。 

标志和方法[编辑]
如帕特里夏·埃文斯（Patricia Evans）所述，观察到的施虐者有七个“警告标志”：[23]

向受害者的隐瞒讯息；
反击讯息以符合施虐者的观点；
冷处理讯息；
经常以玩笑的形式进行口头虐待；
阻止和转移受害者对外界的关注；
轻描淡写（“最小化”）受害者的价值；
通过逐渐削弱受害者及其思维过程来破坏受害者心理认知。
埃文斯（Evans）认为有必要了解这些警告标志，以便从该处开始治疗过程[23]。
心理学家埃里诺·格林伯格（Elinor Greenberg）描述三种常见的煤气灯效应方法：[17]

隐藏。虐待者可能向受害者隐瞒或掩盖他们所做的事情。虐待者不会感到羞耻，反而会说服受害者怀疑自己对情况的看法，并把责任归咎于自己。
不断变化。滥用者感到有必要改变受害者的某些东西。无论是受害者的着装或行为方式，他们都希望受害者融入自己的幻想中。如果受害者不遵守，虐待者可能会说服受害者认为自己实际上还不够好。
关系中的控制。虐待者可能希望完全控制受害者并对其拥有控制权。在这种情况下，施虐者会试图将他们与其他朋友和家人隔离开来，以便只有他们才能影响受害者的思想和行为。虐待者享受受害者完全受自己控制的权力感和控制感。
离婚程序教练林赛·埃里森（Lindsey Ellison）所描述的施虐者的最终目标是让受害者重新考量自己的选择并质疑自己的理智，使他们更加依赖施虐者[24]，当中用来降低受害者自尊心的一种策略是施虐者在无视和照顾受害者之间交替，从而使受害者降低对情感的期望，并认为自己不值得他人付出感情[查证请求]。

性别角色[编辑]
心理治疗师斯蒂芬妮·莫尔顿·萨基斯观察发现，煤气灯效应存在于她所治疗的约30至40％的夫妻中，她说：“男性和女性有同样的可能性进行煤气灯效应”[25]，并表示：“据我们所知，性别在这里同等地表现出来。”[13]:27；她进一步解释，我们倾向于认为使用煤气灯效应的是男性居多，因为“男人往往更不愿意（也许是不好意思）与他人谈及女性伴侣的情感虐待”。:27
社会学家佩奇·斯威特（Paige Sweet）在社会不平等和举足轻重的家庭暴力亲密关系背景下研究煤气灯效应认为，“这种策略是性别化的，因为它们依赖于女性气质与非理性的联系。”[26]。
根据哲学教授凯特·艾布拉姆森（Kate Abramson）的观点，煤气灯效应的行为与性别歧视并没有特别的联系，尽管与男性相比，女性往往更经常成为受煤气灯效应影响的对象[3]。艾布拉姆森对此解释认为，这是社会条件的结果，并说：“这是性别歧视结构的一部分，认为女性比男性更没自信，对我们自身所抱持的观点、信念、反应和看法的怀疑程度要高于男性。而煤气灯效应旨在破坏某人的观点、信念、反应和看法。各种形式自我怀疑的性别歧视规范导致我们更易于出现此情形。”艾布拉姆森说，煤气灯效应的最后“阶段”是严重的临床抑郁症。哲学教授希尔德·林德曼（Hilde Lindemann）特别在谈及妇女时表示，在这种情况下，受害者抵抗操纵的能力取决于“她相信自身判断的能力”，建立心理认知的“对抗区”可以帮助受害者重新获得“普通水平的自由性”[27]。

政治事务[编辑]
专栏作家莫琳·道德（Maureen Dowd）是最早在政治背景下使用该术语的人之一[28]，她描述比尔·克林顿政府使用这项技术使纽特·金里奇受到小侮辱的意图，目的是激怒他向公众提出“歇斯底里”的投诉[29][30]。 
心理学家布莱恩特·韦尔奇（Bryant Welch）在其2008年的《混乱状态：政治操纵与对美国思想的攻击》一书中，描述该技术在现代传播时代开始在美国政治中的普遍性。 
记者弗里达·吉蒂斯（Frida Ghitis）用“点燃汽油”一词形容俄罗斯的全球关系。在俄罗斯特工活跃在克里米亚的同时，俄罗斯官员不断否认相关人员的存在，并操纵对政治团体的不信任来支持他们。[31]
《纽约时报杂志》，BBC和《青少年时尚》杂志的记者以及心理学家布莱恩特·韦尔奇、罗伯特·费尔德曼和莉亚·麦克艾拉斯都描述唐纳德·特朗普在2016年美国总统大选期间的某些行为以及他担任总统期间的举动[29][32][33][34][35]。新闻学教授本·雅格达（Ben Yagoda）在2017年1月《高等教育纪事报》中写道，由于特朗普的举动，“加油”一词再次成为热门话题，他说特朗普的“习惯性倾向说‘X’，接着在往后的某个日子里愤愤不平。”并声明“我没有说‘X’。实际上，我永远也不会梦想说‘X’”，为该术语带来新的注解[28]。
此外，宗派团体的领导者和追随者利用煤气灯效应以确保整合任何可能偏离团体的成员[36]。

工作职场[编辑]
当人们做的事情导致同事对自己及其行为提出质疑，而这对当事人的职业表现评价有所损害时，便会在工作场所引起人们关注[37]；受害者在此情境中可能被排除在任职场域的讨论外，成为他人讨论的流言蜚语，长期受到抹黑或质疑导致其信心遭破坏，施害者可能会将相关谈话转移到感知到的错误上[38]。任何人都可以操纵煤气灯效应，当施害者拥有权力时将特别有害[39]。

流行文化[编辑]
流行乐队Steely Dan在其2000年发行的专辑“ Two Against Nature ”中演唱一首名为“ Gaslighting Abbie”的歌曲。
2016年的神秘和心理惊悚片《列车上的女孩》（The Girl on the Train）探索了乘汽油对主角雷切尔（Rachel）的直接影响[29]，曾身为暴力虐待者的瑞秋前夫汤姆是受害者。雷切尔患有严重的抑郁症并且会酗酒，当蕾切尔喝醉时，他总是告诉瑞秋，她做了一些她不记得的可怕事情[40]。 
煤气灯效应是英国广播公司广播电视剧《弓箭手》中2016年情节的主题。这个故事描述海伦·阿切尔（Helen Archer）的伴侣和后来的丈夫罗布·蒂切纳（Rob Titchener）在两年期间对他们的情感虐待，引起公众对该现象的广泛讨论[41]。
在2018年的几个月中，煤气灯效应是NBC电视剧《我们的生活》中的主要情节。剧中角色加比·埃尔南德斯（Gabi Hernandez）在加比因谋杀阿比盖尔（Abigail）在该系列中所犯下的罪行而陷害后，向她最好的朋友阿比盖尔（Abigail Deveroux）放火[42]。 
2020年3月，Dixie Chicks发行一首名为“ Gaslighter ”的歌曲，这是他们即将发行的专辑Gaslighter的主打曲目，歌曲中提到“gaslighting”一词[43]，其灵感来自于主唱娜塔莉·缅因与丈夫演员阿德里安·帕斯达尔（Adrian Pasdar）离婚[44]。

012. 后来，精神病医生西奥多·多帕特（Theodore Dorpat）将此种受害者无意识心理内容的“转移”描述为“投射性认同​（英语）”的一个例子[16][1]:5–6, 40。在受害者并未意识到自己正受到煤气灯效应影响时，投射性认同对其最有效，若受害者自身也认同“转移”的内容（所投射的内容），则它将具有破坏性；但是，当受害人变得能够不相信且不认同投射性认同所产生的负面内投时，这些影响就会被抵消。

013. 人格障碍

014. 社交变态者和自恋者[17]经常使用煤气灯效应来虐待和破坏受害者的心理认知。社会变态者一贯违背社会道德规范，违反法律并利用他人，且通常也是令人信服的说谎者，有时甚至是迷人的说谎者，他们始终否认有不法行为；因此，一些受到社会变态者伤害的人可能会怀疑自己的看法[18]。一些虐待配偶身体的人可能断然否认自己曾行使暴力，从而对伴侣产生煤气灯效果[2]；煤气灯效应也可以在亲子关系中发生，其中父母、子女或双方说谎并试图破坏对方的心理知觉[19]。

015. 精神病学

016. 在精神病人的住院设施中，患者与工作人员之间发现煤气灯效应现象[20]。Dorpat在1996年的一本书中表示，“煤气灯效应和其他人际关系控制方法被心理健康领域专业人士以及其他人广泛使用”，因为它们是塑造他人行为的有效方法[1]:45；他另表示，临床医生使用具有威权主义态度的人际控制的秘密方法，例如煤气灯效应:xiii–xxi，他也建议临床医生采取更多非指导性和平等主义的态度和方法:225，“将患者视为积极的合作者和平等伙伴”:246。

017. 浪漫关系

018. 在人际关系中，加害者“需要是正确的”，以便“保留（自己的）自我意识”和“（自己）在世界上拥有权力的意识”；受害者允许加害者“定义（自身的）现实感”，以至于受害者将对方“理想化”并“寻求（对方的）认可”[6]:3。心理操纵可包括使受害者质疑自己的记忆、知觉和理智，加害者可能会使用轻蔑的语言无效化 (invalidate) 受害者的感受，比如：“你疯了。别那么敏感。不要偏执。我只是在开玩笑！我很担心；我认为你身体不好。”等[3]。 
心理学家吉尔·罗杰斯（Jill Rogers）和黛安·弗林斯塔德（ Diane Follingstad）表示，这种忽视可能会对心理健康产生不利影响。他们将心理虐待描述为：“通过胁迫、控制、口头虐待、监视、孤立、威胁、嫉妒、屈辱、操纵、劣等对待、创造敌对环境，在性和忠诚方面伤害伴侣，在情感上和/或身体上对伴侣有所隐瞒等做法，以伤害他人的一系列令人厌恶的行为。”[21]。在一些婚姻不忠的案例中，人们发现煤气灯效应现象：“治疗师可能通过错误地标记受害者的反应加剧受害者的痛苦。配偶的煤气灯行为可能导致某些受害者产生‘神经衰弱’甚至在某些最恶劣的情况下自杀。”[19][22]。
心理学家格特鲁德·泽蒙·加斯和威廉·尼科尔斯在其1988年的文章〈煤气灯效应：婚姻综合症〉中研究男人的婚外情及其对妻子的影响[22]，他们描述一个男人如何试图说服妻子她在捕风捉影，而不是承认自己有外遇：“一个妻子在自己家里接电话，却在不经意间偷听到丈夫在出差途中和女友幽会的计划。”，丈夫质疑她的感知证据加以否认：“我没有和任何女友通电话。你一定在做梦。”。 
罗杰斯（Rogers）和弗林斯坦德（Follingstand）考察女性的心理虐待经历，这些经历可以作为抑郁、焦虑、躯体化、自杀意念和生活功能的症状以及临床水平的预测指标。他们得出结论，心理虐待会影响妇女的心理健康状态，但是与实体的虐待相比，人们感知到的性格、关系模式和反应方式的负面变化是心理健康结果的更有效指标[21]。心理治疗师斯蒂芬妮·莫尔顿·萨基斯（Stephanie Moulton Sarkis）解释说，“保持一定程度的认知失调才能与煤气灯效应的使用者保持连结”，而在这种情况下，“解决认知失调的最健康方法”涉及“让自己离开或远离操纵煤气灯效应的人”[13]:24–25。 

标志和方法[编辑]
如帕特里夏·埃文斯（Patricia Evans）所述，观察到的施虐者有七个“警告标志”：[23]

向受害者的隐瞒讯息；
反击讯息以符合施虐者的观点；
冷处理讯息；
经常以玩笑的形式进行口头虐待；
阻止和转移受害者对外界的关注；
轻描淡写（“最小化”）受害者的价值；
通过逐渐削弱受害者及其思维过程来破坏受害者心理认知。
埃文斯（Evans）认为有必要了解这些警告标志，以便从该处开始治疗过程[23]。
心理学家埃里诺·格林伯格（Elinor Greenberg）描述三种常见的煤气灯效应方法：[17]

隐藏。虐待者可能向受害者隐瞒或掩盖他们所做的事情。虐待者不会感到羞耻，反而会说服受害者怀疑自己对情况的看法，并把责任归咎于自己。
不断变化。滥用者感到有必要改变受害者的某些东西。无论是受害者的着装或行为方式，他们都希望受害者融入自己的幻想中。如果受害者不遵守，虐待者可能会说服受害者认为自己实际上还不够好。
关系中的控制。虐待者可能希望完全控制受害者并对其拥有控制权。在这种情况下，施虐者会试图将他们与其他朋友和家人隔离开来，以便只有他们才能影响受害者的思想和行为。虐待者享受受害者完全受自己控制的权力感和控制感。
离婚程序教练林赛·埃里森（Lindsey Ellison）所描述的施虐者的最终目标是让受害者重新考量自己的选择并质疑自己的理智，使他们更加依赖施虐者[24]，当中用来降低受害者自尊心的一种策略是施虐者在无视和照顾受害者之间交替，从而使受害者降低对情感的期望，并认为自己不值得他人付出感情[查证请求]。

性别角色[编辑]
心理治疗师斯蒂芬妮·莫尔顿·萨基斯观察发现，煤气灯效应存在于她所治疗的约30至40％的夫妻中，她说：“男性和女性有同样的可能性进行煤气灯效应”[25]，并表示：“据我们所知，性别在这里同等地表现出来。”[13]:27；她进一步解释，我们倾向于认为使用煤气灯效应的是男性居多，因为“男人往往更不愿意（也许是不好意思）与他人谈及女性伴侣的情感虐待”。:27
社会学家佩奇·斯威特（Paige Sweet）在社会不平等和举足轻重的家庭暴力亲密关系背景下研究煤气灯效应认为，“这种策略是性别化的，因为它们依赖于女性气质与非理性的联系。”[26]。
根据哲学教授凯特·艾布拉姆森（Kate Abramson）的观点，煤气灯效应的行为与性别歧视并没有特别的联系，尽管与男性相比，女性往往更经常成为受煤气灯效应影响的对象[3]。艾布拉姆森对此解释认为，这是社会条件的结果，并说：“这是性别歧视结构的一部分，认为女性比男性更没自信，对我们自身所抱持的观点、信念、反应和看法的怀疑程度要高于男性。而煤气灯效应旨在破坏某人的观点、信念、反应和看法。各种形式自我怀疑的性别歧视规范导致我们更易于出现此情形。”艾布拉姆森说，煤气灯效应的最后“阶段”是严重的临床抑郁症。哲学教授希尔德·林德曼（Hilde Lindemann）特别在谈及妇女时表示，在这种情况下，受害者抵抗操纵的能力取决于“她相信自身判断的能力”，建立心理认知的“对抗区”可以帮助受害者重新获得“普通水平的自由性”[27]。

政治事务[编辑]
专栏作家莫琳·道德（Maureen Dowd）是最早在政治背景下使用该术语的人之一[28]，她描述比尔·克林顿政府使用这项技术使纽特·金里奇受到小侮辱的意图，目的是激怒他向公众提出“歇斯底里”的投诉[29][30]。 
心理学家布莱恩特·韦尔奇（Bryant Welch）在其2008年的《混乱状态：政治操纵与对美国思想的攻击》一书中，描述该技术在现代传播时代开始在美国政治中的普遍性。 
记者弗里达·吉蒂斯（Frida Ghitis）用“点燃汽油”一词形容俄罗斯的全球关系。在俄罗斯特工活跃在克里米亚的同时，俄罗斯官员不断否认相关人员的存在，并操纵对政治团体的不信任来支持他们。[31]
《纽约时报杂志》，BBC和《青少年时尚》杂志的记者以及心理学家布莱恩特·韦尔奇、罗伯特·费尔德曼和莉亚·麦克艾拉斯都描述唐纳德·特朗普在2016年美国总统大选期间的某些行为以及他担任总统期间的举动[29][32][33][34][35]。新闻学教授本·雅格达（Ben Yagoda）在2017年1月《高等教育纪事报》中写道，由于特朗普的举动，“加油”一词再次成为热门话题，他说特朗普的“习惯性倾向说‘X’，接着在往后的某个日子里愤愤不平。”并声明“我没有说‘X’。实际上，我永远也不会梦想说‘X’”，为该术语带来新的注解[28]。
此外，宗派团体的领导者和追随者利用煤气灯效应以确保整合任何可能偏离团体的成员[36]。

工作职场[编辑]
当人们做的事情导致同事对自己及其行为提出质疑，而这对当事人的职业表现评价有所损害时，便会在工作场所引起人们关注[37]；受害者在此情境中可能被排除在任职场域的讨论外，成为他人讨论的流言蜚语，长期受到抹黑或质疑导致其信心遭破坏，施害者可能会将相关谈话转移到感知到的错误上[38]。任何人都可以操纵煤气灯效应，当施害者拥有权力时将特别有害[39]。

流行文化[编辑]
流行乐队Steely Dan在其2000年发行的专辑“ Two Against Nature ”中演唱一首名为“ Gaslighting Abbie”的歌曲。
2016年的神秘和心理惊悚片《列车上的女孩》（The Girl on the Train）探索了乘汽油对主角雷切尔（Rachel）的直接影响[29]，曾身为暴力虐待者的瑞秋前夫汤姆是受害者。雷切尔患有严重的抑郁症并且会酗酒，当蕾切尔喝醉时，他总是告诉瑞秋，她做了一些她不记得的可怕事情[40]。 
煤气灯效应是英国广播公司广播电视剧《弓箭手》中2016年情节的主题。这个故事描述海伦·阿切尔（Helen Archer）的伴侣和后来的丈夫罗布·蒂切纳（Rob Titchener）在两年期间对他们的情感虐待，引起公众对该现象的广泛讨论[41]。
在2018年的几个月中，煤气灯效应是NBC电视剧《我们的生活》中的主要情节。剧中角色加比·埃尔南德斯（Gabi Hernandez）在加比因谋杀阿比盖尔（Abigail）在该系列中所犯下的罪行而陷害后，向她最好的朋友阿比盖尔（Abigail Deveroux）放火[42]。 
2020年3月，Dixie Chicks发行一首名为“ Gaslighter ”的歌曲，这是他们即将发行的专辑Gaslighter的主打曲目，歌曲中提到“gaslighting”一词[43]，其灵感来自于主唱娜塔莉·缅因与丈夫演员阿德里安·帕斯达尔（Adrian Pasdar）离婚[44]。

019. 心理学家吉尔·罗杰斯（Jill Rogers）和黛安·弗林斯塔德（ Diane Follingstad）表示，这种忽视可能会对心理健康产生不利影响。他们将心理虐待描述为：“通过胁迫、控制、口头虐待、监视、孤立、威胁、嫉妒、屈辱、操纵、劣等对待、创造敌对环境，在性和忠诚方面伤害伴侣，在情感上和/或身体上对伴侣有所隐瞒等做法，以伤害他人的一系列令人厌恶的行为。”[21]。在一些婚姻不忠的案例中，人们发现煤气灯效应现象：“治疗师可能通过错误地标记受害者的反应加剧受害者的痛苦。配偶的煤气灯行为可能导致某些受害者产生‘神经衰弱’甚至在某些最恶劣的情况下自杀。”[19][22]。
心理学家格特鲁德·泽蒙·加斯和威廉·尼科尔斯在其1988年的文章〈煤气灯效应：婚姻综合症〉中研究男人的婚外情及其对妻子的影响[22]，他们描述一个男人如何试图说服妻子她在捕风捉影，而不是承认自己有外遇：“一个妻子在自己家里接电话，却在不经意间偷听到丈夫在出差途中和女友幽会的计划。”，丈夫质疑她的感知证据加以否认：“我没有和任何女友通电话。你一定在做梦。”。 
罗杰斯（Rogers）和弗林斯坦德（Follingstand）考察女性的心理虐待经历，这些经历可以作为抑郁、焦虑、躯体化、自杀意念和生活功能的症状以及临床水平的预测指标。他们得出结论，心理虐待会影响妇女的心理健康状态，但是与实体的虐待相比，人们感知到的性格、关系模式和反应方式的负面变化是心理健康结果的更有效指标[21]。心理治疗师斯蒂芬妮·莫尔顿·萨基斯（Stephanie Moulton Sarkis）解释说，“保持一定程度的认知失调才能与煤气灯效应的使用者保持连结”，而在这种情况下，“解决认知失调的最健康方法”涉及“让自己离开或远离操纵煤气灯效应的人”[13]:24–25。 

标志和方法[编辑]
如帕特里夏·埃文斯（Patricia Evans）所述，观察到的施虐者有七个“警告标志”：[23]

向受害者的隐瞒讯息；
反击讯息以符合施虐者的观点；
冷处理讯息；
经常以玩笑的形式进行口头虐待；
阻止和转移受害者对外界的关注；
轻描淡写（“最小化”）受害者的价值；
通过逐渐削弱受害者及其思维过程来破坏受害者心理认知。
埃文斯（Evans）认为有必要了解这些警告标志，以便从该处开始治疗过程[23]。
心理学家埃里诺·格林伯格（Elinor Greenberg）描述三种常见的煤气灯效应方法：[17]

隐藏。虐待者可能向受害者隐瞒或掩盖他们所做的事情。虐待者不会感到羞耻，反而会说服受害者怀疑自己对情况的看法，并把责任归咎于自己。
不断变化。滥用者感到有必要改变受害者的某些东西。无论是受害者的着装或行为方式，他们都希望受害者融入自己的幻想中。如果受害者不遵守，虐待者可能会说服受害者认为自己实际上还不够好。
关系中的控制。虐待者可能希望完全控制受害者并对其拥有控制权。在这种情况下，施虐者会试图将他们与其他朋友和家人隔离开来，以便只有他们才能影响受害者的思想和行为。虐待者享受受害者完全受自己控制的权力感和控制感。
离婚程序教练林赛·埃里森（Lindsey Ellison）所描述的施虐者的最终目标是让受害者重新考量自己的选择并质疑自己的理智，使他们更加依赖施虐者[24]，当中用来降低受害者自尊心的一种策略是施虐者在无视和照顾受害者之间交替，从而使受害者降低对情感的期望，并认为自己不值得他人付出感情[查证请求]。

性别角色[编辑]
心理治疗师斯蒂芬妮·莫尔顿·萨基斯观察发现，煤气灯效应存在于她所治疗的约30至40％的夫妻中，她说：“男性和女性有同样的可能性进行煤气灯效应”[25]，并表示：“据我们所知，性别在这里同等地表现出来。”[13]:27；她进一步解释，我们倾向于认为使用煤气灯效应的是男性居多，因为“男人往往更不愿意（也许是不好意思）与他人谈及女性伴侣的情感虐待”。:27
社会学家佩奇·斯威特（Paige Sweet）在社会不平等和举足轻重的家庭暴力亲密关系背景下研究煤气灯效应认为，“这种策略是性别化的，因为它们依赖于女性气质与非理性的联系。”[26]。
根据哲学教授凯特·艾布拉姆森（Kate Abramson）的观点，煤气灯效应的行为与性别歧视并没有特别的联系，尽管与男性相比，女性往往更经常成为受煤气灯效应影响的对象[3]。艾布拉姆森对此解释认为，这是社会条件的结果，并说：“这是性别歧视结构的一部分，认为女性比男性更没自信，对我们自身所抱持的观点、信念、反应和看法的怀疑程度要高于男性。而煤气灯效应旨在破坏某人的观点、信念、反应和看法。各种形式自我怀疑的性别歧视规范导致我们更易于出现此情形。”艾布拉姆森说，煤气灯效应的最后“阶段”是严重的临床抑郁症。哲学教授希尔德·林德曼（Hilde Lindemann）特别在谈及妇女时表示，在这种情况下，受害者抵抗操纵的能力取决于“她相信自身判断的能力”，建立心理认知的“对抗区”可以帮助受害者重新获得“普通水平的自由性”[27]。

政治事务[编辑]
专栏作家莫琳·道德（Maureen Dowd）是最早在政治背景下使用该术语的人之一[28]，她描述比尔·克林顿政府使用这项技术使纽特·金里奇受到小侮辱的意图，目的是激怒他向公众提出“歇斯底里”的投诉[29][30]。 
心理学家布莱恩特·韦尔奇（Bryant Welch）在其2008年的《混乱状态：政治操纵与对美国思想的攻击》一书中，描述该技术在现代传播时代开始在美国政治中的普遍性。 
记者弗里达·吉蒂斯（Frida Ghitis）用“点燃汽油”一词形容俄罗斯的全球关系。在俄罗斯特工活跃在克里米亚的同时，俄罗斯官员不断否认相关人员的存在，并操纵对政治团体的不信任来支持他们。[31]
《纽约时报杂志》，BBC和《青少年时尚》杂志的记者以及心理学家布莱恩特·韦尔奇、罗伯特·费尔德曼和莉亚·麦克艾拉斯都描述唐纳德·特朗普在2016年美国总统大选期间的某些行为以及他担任总统期间的举动[29][32][33][34][35]。新闻学教授本·雅格达（Ben Yagoda）在2017年1月《高等教育纪事报》中写道，由于特朗普的举动，“加油”一词再次成为热门话题，他说特朗普的“习惯性倾向说‘X’，接着在往后的某个日子里愤愤不平。”并声明“我没有说‘X’。实际上，我永远也不会梦想说‘X’”，为该术语带来新的注解[28]。
此外，宗派团体的领导者和追随者利用煤气灯效应以确保整合任何可能偏离团体的成员[36]。

工作职场[编辑]
当人们做的事情导致同事对自己及其行为提出质疑，而这对当事人的职业表现评价有所损害时，便会在工作场所引起人们关注[37]；受害者在此情境中可能被排除在任职场域的讨论外，成为他人讨论的流言蜚语，长期受到抹黑或质疑导致其信心遭破坏，施害者可能会将相关谈话转移到感知到的错误上[38]。任何人都可以操纵煤气灯效应，当施害者拥有权力时将特别有害[39]。

流行文化[编辑]
流行乐队Steely Dan在其2000年发行的专辑“ Two Against Nature ”中演唱一首名为“ Gaslighting Abbie”的歌曲。
2016年的神秘和心理惊悚片《列车上的女孩》（The Girl on the Train）探索了乘汽油对主角雷切尔（Rachel）的直接影响[29]，曾身为暴力虐待者的瑞秋前夫汤姆是受害者。雷切尔患有严重的抑郁症并且会酗酒，当蕾切尔喝醉时，他总是告诉瑞秋，她做了一些她不记得的可怕事情[40]。 
煤气灯效应是英国广播公司广播电视剧《弓箭手》中2016年情节的主题。这个故事描述海伦·阿切尔（Helen Archer）的伴侣和后来的丈夫罗布·蒂切纳（Rob Titchener）在两年期间对他们的情感虐待，引起公众对该现象的广泛讨论[41]。
在2018年的几个月中，煤气灯效应是NBC电视剧《我们的生活》中的主要情节。剧中角色加比·埃尔南德斯（Gabi Hernandez）在加比因谋杀阿比盖尔（Abigail）在该系列中所犯下的罪行而陷害后，向她最好的朋友阿比盖尔（Abigail Deveroux）放火[42]。 
2020年3月，Dixie Chicks发行一首名为“ Gaslighter ”的歌曲，这是他们即将发行的专辑Gaslighter的主打曲目，歌曲中提到“gaslighting”一词[43]，其灵感来自于主唱娜塔莉·缅因与丈夫演员阿德里安·帕斯达尔（Adrian Pasdar）离婚[44]。

020. 心理学家格特鲁德·泽蒙·加斯和威廉·尼科尔斯在其1988年的文章〈煤气灯效应：婚姻综合症〉中研究男人的婚外情及其对妻子的影响[22]，他们描述一个男人如何试图说服妻子她在捕风捉影，而不是承认自己有外遇：“一个妻子在自己家里接电话，却在不经意间偷听到丈夫在出差途中和女友幽会的计划。”，丈夫质疑她的感知证据加以否认：“我没有和任何女友通电话。你一定在做梦。”。 
罗杰斯（Rogers）和弗林斯坦德（Follingstand）考察女性的心理虐待经历，这些经历可以作为抑郁、焦虑、躯体化、自杀意念和生活功能的症状以及临床水平的预测指标。他们得出结论，心理虐待会影响妇女的心理健康状态，但是与实体的虐待相比，人们感知到的性格、关系模式和反应方式的负面变化是心理健康结果的更有效指标[21]。心理治疗师斯蒂芬妮·莫尔顿·萨基斯（Stephanie Moulton Sarkis）解释说，“保持一定程度的认知失调才能与煤气灯效应的使用者保持连结”，而在这种情况下，“解决认知失调的最健康方法”涉及“让自己离开或远离操纵煤气灯效应的人”[13]:24–25。 

标志和方法[编辑]
如帕特里夏·埃文斯（Patricia Evans）所述，观察到的施虐者有七个“警告标志”：[23]

向受害者的隐瞒讯息；
反击讯息以符合施虐者的观点；
冷处理讯息；
经常以玩笑的形式进行口头虐待；
阻止和转移受害者对外界的关注；
轻描淡写（“最小化”）受害者的价值；
通过逐渐削弱受害者及其思维过程来破坏受害者心理认知。
埃文斯（Evans）认为有必要了解这些警告标志，以便从该处开始治疗过程[23]。
心理学家埃里诺·格林伯格（Elinor Greenberg）描述三种常见的煤气灯效应方法：[17]

隐藏。虐待者可能向受害者隐瞒或掩盖他们所做的事情。虐待者不会感到羞耻，反而会说服受害者怀疑自己对情况的看法，并把责任归咎于自己。
不断变化。滥用者感到有必要改变受害者的某些东西。无论是受害者的着装或行为方式，他们都希望受害者融入自己的幻想中。如果受害者不遵守，虐待者可能会说服受害者认为自己实际上还不够好。
关系中的控制。虐待者可能希望完全控制受害者并对其拥有控制权。在这种情况下，施虐者会试图将他们与其他朋友和家人隔离开来，以便只有他们才能影响受害者的思想和行为。虐待者享受受害者完全受自己控制的权力感和控制感。
离婚程序教练林赛·埃里森（Lindsey Ellison）所描述的施虐者的最终目标是让受害者重新考量自己的选择并质疑自己的理智，使他们更加依赖施虐者[24]，当中用来降低受害者自尊心的一种策略是施虐者在无视和照顾受害者之间交替，从而使受害者降低对情感的期望，并认为自己不值得他人付出感情[查证请求]。

性别角色[编辑]
心理治疗师斯蒂芬妮·莫尔顿·萨基斯观察发现，煤气灯效应存在于她所治疗的约30至40％的夫妻中，她说：“男性和女性有同样的可能性进行煤气灯效应”[25]，并表示：“据我们所知，性别在这里同等地表现出来。”[13]:27；她进一步解释，我们倾向于认为使用煤气灯效应的是男性居多，因为“男人往往更不愿意（也许是不好意思）与他人谈及女性伴侣的情感虐待”。:27
社会学家佩奇·斯威特（Paige Sweet）在社会不平等和举足轻重的家庭暴力亲密关系背景下研究煤气灯效应认为，“这种策略是性别化的，因为它们依赖于女性气质与非理性的联系。”[26]。
根据哲学教授凯特·艾布拉姆森（Kate Abramson）的观点，煤气灯效应的行为与性别歧视并没有特别的联系，尽管与男性相比，女性往往更经常成为受煤气灯效应影响的对象[3]。艾布拉姆森对此解释认为，这是社会条件的结果，并说：“这是性别歧视结构的一部分，认为女性比男性更没自信，对我们自身所抱持的观点、信念、反应和看法的怀疑程度要高于男性。而煤气灯效应旨在破坏某人的观点、信念、反应和看法。各种形式自我怀疑的性别歧视规范导致我们更易于出现此情形。”艾布拉姆森说，煤气灯效应的最后“阶段”是严重的临床抑郁症。哲学教授希尔德·林德曼（Hilde Lindemann）特别在谈及妇女时表示，在这种情况下，受害者抵抗操纵的能力取决于“她相信自身判断的能力”，建立心理认知的“对抗区”可以帮助受害者重新获得“普通水平的自由性”[27]。

政治事务[编辑]
专栏作家莫琳·道德（Maureen Dowd）是最早在政治背景下使用该术语的人之一[28]，她描述比尔·克林顿政府使用这项技术使纽特·金里奇受到小侮辱的意图，目的是激怒他向公众提出“歇斯底里”的投诉[29][30]。 
心理学家布莱恩特·韦尔奇（Bryant Welch）在其2008年的《混乱状态：政治操纵与对美国思想的攻击》一书中，描述该技术在现代传播时代开始在美国政治中的普遍性。 
记者弗里达·吉蒂斯（Frida Ghitis）用“点燃汽油”一词形容俄罗斯的全球关系。在俄罗斯特工活跃在克里米亚的同时，俄罗斯官员不断否认相关人员的存在，并操纵对政治团体的不信任来支持他们。[31]
《纽约时报杂志》，BBC和《青少年时尚》杂志的记者以及心理学家布莱恩特·韦尔奇、罗伯特·费尔德曼和莉亚·麦克艾拉斯都描述唐纳德·特朗普在2016年美国总统大选期间的某些行为以及他担任总统期间的举动[29][32][33][34][35]。新闻学教授本·雅格达（Ben Yagoda）在2017年1月《高等教育纪事报》中写道，由于特朗普的举动，“加油”一词再次成为热门话题，他说特朗普的“习惯性倾向说‘X’，接着在往后的某个日子里愤愤不平。”并声明“我没有说‘X’。实际上，我永远也不会梦想说‘X’”，为该术语带来新的注解[28]。
此外，宗派团体的领导者和追随者利用煤气灯效应以确保整合任何可能偏离团体的成员[36]。

工作职场[编辑]
当人们做的事情导致同事对自己及其行为提出质疑，而这对当事人的职业表现评价有所损害时，便会在工作场所引起人们关注[37]；受害者在此情境中可能被排除在任职场域的讨论外，成为他人讨论的流言蜚语，长期受到抹黑或质疑导致其信心遭破坏，施害者可能会将相关谈话转移到感知到的错误上[38]。任何人都可以操纵煤气灯效应，当施害者拥有权力时将特别有害[39]。

流行文化[编辑]
流行乐队Steely Dan在其2000年发行的专辑“ Two Against Nature ”中演唱一首名为“ Gaslighting Abbie”的歌曲。
2016年的神秘和心理惊悚片《列车上的女孩》（The Girl on the Train）探索了乘汽油对主角雷切尔（Rachel）的直接影响[29]，曾身为暴力虐待者的瑞秋前夫汤姆是受害者。雷切尔患有严重的抑郁症并且会酗酒，当蕾切尔喝醉时，他总是告诉瑞秋，她做了一些她不记得的可怕事情[40]。 
煤气灯效应是英国广播公司广播电视剧《弓箭手》中2016年情节的主题。这个故事描述海伦·阿切尔（Helen Archer）的伴侣和后来的丈夫罗布·蒂切纳（Rob Titchener）在两年期间对他们的情感虐待，引起公众对该现象的广泛讨论[41]。
在2018年的几个月中，煤气灯效应是NBC电视剧《我们的生活》中的主要情节。剧中角色加比·埃尔南德斯（Gabi Hernandez）在加比因谋杀阿比盖尔（Abigail）在该系列中所犯下的罪行而陷害后，向她最好的朋友阿比盖尔（Abigail Deveroux）放火[42]。 
2020年3月，Dixie Chicks发行一首名为“ Gaslighter ”的歌曲，这是他们即将发行的专辑Gaslighter的主打曲目，歌曲中提到“gaslighting”一词[43]，其灵感来自于主唱娜塔莉·缅因与丈夫演员阿德里安·帕斯达尔（Adrian Pasdar）离婚[44]。

021. 罗杰斯（Rogers）和弗林斯坦德（Follingstand）考察女性的心理虐待经历，这些经历可以作为抑郁、焦虑、躯体化、自杀意念和生活功能的症状以及临床水平的预测指标。他们得出结论，心理虐待会影响妇女的心理健康状态，但是与实体的虐待相比，人们感知到的性格、关系模式和反应方式的负面变化是心理健康结果的更有效指标[21]。心理治疗师斯蒂芬妮·莫尔顿·萨基斯（Stephanie Moulton Sarkis）解释说，“保持一定程度的认知失调才能与煤气灯效应的使用者保持连结”，而在这种情况下，“解决认知失调的最健康方法”涉及“让自己离开或远离操纵煤气灯效应的人”[13]:24–25。

022. 标志和方法

023. 如帕特里夏·埃文斯（Patricia Evans）所述，观察到的施虐者有七个“警告标志”：[23]

024. 向受害者的隐瞒讯息；

025. 反击讯息以符合施虐者的观点；

026. 冷处理讯息；

027. 经常以玩笑的形式进行口头虐待；

028. 阻止和转移受害者对外界的关注；

029. 轻描淡写（“最小化”）受害者的价值；

030. 通过逐渐削弱受害者及其思维过程来破坏受害者心理认知。

031. 埃文斯（Evans）认为有必要了解这些警告标志，以便从该处开始治疗过程[23]。
心理学家埃里诺·格林伯格（Elinor Greenberg）描述三种常见的煤气灯效应方法：[17]

隐藏。虐待者可能向受害者隐瞒或掩盖他们所做的事情。虐待者不会感到羞耻，反而会说服受害者怀疑自己对情况的看法，并把责任归咎于自己。
不断变化。滥用者感到有必要改变受害者的某些东西。无论是受害者的着装或行为方式，他们都希望受害者融入自己的幻想中。如果受害者不遵守，虐待者可能会说服受害者认为自己实际上还不够好。
关系中的控制。虐待者可能希望完全控制受害者并对其拥有控制权。在这种情况下，施虐者会试图将他们与其他朋友和家人隔离开来，以便只有他们才能影响受害者的思想和行为。虐待者享受受害者完全受自己控制的权力感和控制感。
离婚程序教练林赛·埃里森（Lindsey Ellison）所描述的施虐者的最终目标是让受害者重新考量自己的选择并质疑自己的理智，使他们更加依赖施虐者[24]，当中用来降低受害者自尊心的一种策略是施虐者在无视和照顾受害者之间交替，从而使受害者降低对情感的期望，并认为自己不值得他人付出感情[查证请求]。

性别角色[编辑]
心理治疗师斯蒂芬妮·莫尔顿·萨基斯观察发现，煤气灯效应存在于她所治疗的约30至40％的夫妻中，她说：“男性和女性有同样的可能性进行煤气灯效应”[25]，并表示：“据我们所知，性别在这里同等地表现出来。”[13]:27；她进一步解释，我们倾向于认为使用煤气灯效应的是男性居多，因为“男人往往更不愿意（也许是不好意思）与他人谈及女性伴侣的情感虐待”。:27
社会学家佩奇·斯威特（Paige Sweet）在社会不平等和举足轻重的家庭暴力亲密关系背景下研究煤气灯效应认为，“这种策略是性别化的，因为它们依赖于女性气质与非理性的联系。”[26]。
根据哲学教授凯特·艾布拉姆森（Kate Abramson）的观点，煤气灯效应的行为与性别歧视并没有特别的联系，尽管与男性相比，女性往往更经常成为受煤气灯效应影响的对象[3]。艾布拉姆森对此解释认为，这是社会条件的结果，并说：“这是性别歧视结构的一部分，认为女性比男性更没自信，对我们自身所抱持的观点、信念、反应和看法的怀疑程度要高于男性。而煤气灯效应旨在破坏某人的观点、信念、反应和看法。各种形式自我怀疑的性别歧视规范导致我们更易于出现此情形。”艾布拉姆森说，煤气灯效应的最后“阶段”是严重的临床抑郁症。哲学教授希尔德·林德曼（Hilde Lindemann）特别在谈及妇女时表示，在这种情况下，受害者抵抗操纵的能力取决于“她相信自身判断的能力”，建立心理认知的“对抗区”可以帮助受害者重新获得“普通水平的自由性”[27]。

政治事务[编辑]
专栏作家莫琳·道德（Maureen Dowd）是最早在政治背景下使用该术语的人之一[28]，她描述比尔·克林顿政府使用这项技术使纽特·金里奇受到小侮辱的意图，目的是激怒他向公众提出“歇斯底里”的投诉[29][30]。 
心理学家布莱恩特·韦尔奇（Bryant Welch）在其2008年的《混乱状态：政治操纵与对美国思想的攻击》一书中，描述该技术在现代传播时代开始在美国政治中的普遍性。 
记者弗里达·吉蒂斯（Frida Ghitis）用“点燃汽油”一词形容俄罗斯的全球关系。在俄罗斯特工活跃在克里米亚的同时，俄罗斯官员不断否认相关人员的存在，并操纵对政治团体的不信任来支持他们。[31]
《纽约时报杂志》，BBC和《青少年时尚》杂志的记者以及心理学家布莱恩特·韦尔奇、罗伯特·费尔德曼和莉亚·麦克艾拉斯都描述唐纳德·特朗普在2016年美国总统大选期间的某些行为以及他担任总统期间的举动[29][32][33][34][35]。新闻学教授本·雅格达（Ben Yagoda）在2017年1月《高等教育纪事报》中写道，由于特朗普的举动，“加油”一词再次成为热门话题，他说特朗普的“习惯性倾向说‘X’，接着在往后的某个日子里愤愤不平。”并声明“我没有说‘X’。实际上，我永远也不会梦想说‘X’”，为该术语带来新的注解[28]。
此外，宗派团体的领导者和追随者利用煤气灯效应以确保整合任何可能偏离团体的成员[36]。

工作职场[编辑]
当人们做的事情导致同事对自己及其行为提出质疑，而这对当事人的职业表现评价有所损害时，便会在工作场所引起人们关注[37]；受害者在此情境中可能被排除在任职场域的讨论外，成为他人讨论的流言蜚语，长期受到抹黑或质疑导致其信心遭破坏，施害者可能会将相关谈话转移到感知到的错误上[38]。任何人都可以操纵煤气灯效应，当施害者拥有权力时将特别有害[39]。

流行文化[编辑]
流行乐队Steely Dan在其2000年发行的专辑“ Two Against Nature ”中演唱一首名为“ Gaslighting Abbie”的歌曲。
2016年的神秘和心理惊悚片《列车上的女孩》（The Girl on the Train）探索了乘汽油对主角雷切尔（Rachel）的直接影响[29]，曾身为暴力虐待者的瑞秋前夫汤姆是受害者。雷切尔患有严重的抑郁症并且会酗酒，当蕾切尔喝醉时，他总是告诉瑞秋，她做了一些她不记得的可怕事情[40]。 
煤气灯效应是英国广播公司广播电视剧《弓箭手》中2016年情节的主题。这个故事描述海伦·阿切尔（Helen Archer）的伴侣和后来的丈夫罗布·蒂切纳（Rob Titchener）在两年期间对他们的情感虐待，引起公众对该现象的广泛讨论[41]。
在2018年的几个月中，煤气灯效应是NBC电视剧《我们的生活》中的主要情节。剧中角色加比·埃尔南德斯（Gabi Hernandez）在加比因谋杀阿比盖尔（Abigail）在该系列中所犯下的罪行而陷害后，向她最好的朋友阿比盖尔（Abigail Deveroux）放火[42]。 
2020年3月，Dixie Chicks发行一首名为“ Gaslighter ”的歌曲，这是他们即将发行的专辑Gaslighter的主打曲目，歌曲中提到“gaslighting”一词[43]，其灵感来自于主唱娜塔莉·缅因与丈夫演员阿德里安·帕斯达尔（Adrian Pasdar）离婚[44]。

032. 心理学家埃里诺·格林伯格（Elinor Greenberg）描述三种常见的煤气灯效应方法：[17]

033. 隐藏。虐待者可能向受害者隐瞒或掩盖他们所做的事情。虐待者不会感到羞耻，反而会说服受害者怀疑自己对情况的看法，并把责任归咎于自己。

034. 不断变化。滥用者感到有必要改变受害者的某些东西。无论是受害者的着装或行为方式，他们都希望受害者融入自己的幻想中。如果受害者不遵守，虐待者可能会说服受害者认为自己实际上还不够好。

035. 关系中的控制。虐待者可能希望完全控制受害者并对其拥有控制权。在这种情况下，施虐者会试图将他们与其他朋友和家人隔离开来，以便只有他们才能影响受害者的思想和行为。虐待者享受受害者完全受自己控制的权力感和控制感。

036. 离婚程序教练林赛·埃里森（Lindsey Ellison）所描述的施虐者的最终目标是让受害者重新考量自己的选择并质疑自己的理智，使他们更加依赖施虐者[24]，当中用来降低受害者自尊心的一种策略是施虐者在无视和照顾受害者之间交替，从而使受害者降低对情感的期望，并认为自己不值得他人付出感情[查证请求]。

037. 性别角色

038. 心理治疗师斯蒂芬妮·莫尔顿·萨基斯观察发现，煤气灯效应存在于她所治疗的约30至40％的夫妻中，她说：“男性和女性有同样的可能性进行煤气灯效应”[25]，并表示：“据我们所知，性别在这里同等地表现出来。”[13]:27；她进一步解释，我们倾向于认为使用煤气灯效应的是男性居多，因为“男人往往更不愿意（也许是不好意思）与他人谈及女性伴侣的情感虐待”。:27
社会学家佩奇·斯威特（Paige Sweet）在社会不平等和举足轻重的家庭暴力亲密关系背景下研究煤气灯效应认为，“这种策略是性别化的，因为它们依赖于女性气质与非理性的联系。”[26]。
根据哲学教授凯特·艾布拉姆森（Kate Abramson）的观点，煤气灯效应的行为与性别歧视并没有特别的联系，尽管与男性相比，女性往往更经常成为受煤气灯效应影响的对象[3]。艾布拉姆森对此解释认为，这是社会条件的结果，并说：“这是性别歧视结构的一部分，认为女性比男性更没自信，对我们自身所抱持的观点、信念、反应和看法的怀疑程度要高于男性。而煤气灯效应旨在破坏某人的观点、信念、反应和看法。各种形式自我怀疑的性别歧视规范导致我们更易于出现此情形。”艾布拉姆森说，煤气灯效应的最后“阶段”是严重的临床抑郁症。哲学教授希尔德·林德曼（Hilde Lindemann）特别在谈及妇女时表示，在这种情况下，受害者抵抗操纵的能力取决于“她相信自身判断的能力”，建立心理认知的“对抗区”可以帮助受害者重新获得“普通水平的自由性”[27]。

政治事务[编辑]
专栏作家莫琳·道德（Maureen Dowd）是最早在政治背景下使用该术语的人之一[28]，她描述比尔·克林顿政府使用这项技术使纽特·金里奇受到小侮辱的意图，目的是激怒他向公众提出“歇斯底里”的投诉[29][30]。 
心理学家布莱恩特·韦尔奇（Bryant Welch）在其2008年的《混乱状态：政治操纵与对美国思想的攻击》一书中，描述该技术在现代传播时代开始在美国政治中的普遍性。 
记者弗里达·吉蒂斯（Frida Ghitis）用“点燃汽油”一词形容俄罗斯的全球关系。在俄罗斯特工活跃在克里米亚的同时，俄罗斯官员不断否认相关人员的存在，并操纵对政治团体的不信任来支持他们。[31]
《纽约时报杂志》，BBC和《青少年时尚》杂志的记者以及心理学家布莱恩特·韦尔奇、罗伯特·费尔德曼和莉亚·麦克艾拉斯都描述唐纳德·特朗普在2016年美国总统大选期间的某些行为以及他担任总统期间的举动[29][32][33][34][35]。新闻学教授本·雅格达（Ben Yagoda）在2017年1月《高等教育纪事报》中写道，由于特朗普的举动，“加油”一词再次成为热门话题，他说特朗普的“习惯性倾向说‘X’，接着在往后的某个日子里愤愤不平。”并声明“我没有说‘X’。实际上，我永远也不会梦想说‘X’”，为该术语带来新的注解[28]。
此外，宗派团体的领导者和追随者利用煤气灯效应以确保整合任何可能偏离团体的成员[36]。

工作职场[编辑]
当人们做的事情导致同事对自己及其行为提出质疑，而这对当事人的职业表现评价有所损害时，便会在工作场所引起人们关注[37]；受害者在此情境中可能被排除在任职场域的讨论外，成为他人讨论的流言蜚语，长期受到抹黑或质疑导致其信心遭破坏，施害者可能会将相关谈话转移到感知到的错误上[38]。任何人都可以操纵煤气灯效应，当施害者拥有权力时将特别有害[39]。

流行文化[编辑]
流行乐队Steely Dan在其2000年发行的专辑“ Two Against Nature ”中演唱一首名为“ Gaslighting Abbie”的歌曲。
2016年的神秘和心理惊悚片《列车上的女孩》（The Girl on the Train）探索了乘汽油对主角雷切尔（Rachel）的直接影响[29]，曾身为暴力虐待者的瑞秋前夫汤姆是受害者。雷切尔患有严重的抑郁症并且会酗酒，当蕾切尔喝醉时，他总是告诉瑞秋，她做了一些她不记得的可怕事情[40]。 
煤气灯效应是英国广播公司广播电视剧《弓箭手》中2016年情节的主题。这个故事描述海伦·阿切尔（Helen Archer）的伴侣和后来的丈夫罗布·蒂切纳（Rob Titchener）在两年期间对他们的情感虐待，引起公众对该现象的广泛讨论[41]。
在2018年的几个月中，煤气灯效应是NBC电视剧《我们的生活》中的主要情节。剧中角色加比·埃尔南德斯（Gabi Hernandez）在加比因谋杀阿比盖尔（Abigail）在该系列中所犯下的罪行而陷害后，向她最好的朋友阿比盖尔（Abigail Deveroux）放火[42]。 
2020年3月，Dixie Chicks发行一首名为“ Gaslighter ”的歌曲，这是他们即将发行的专辑Gaslighter的主打曲目，歌曲中提到“gaslighting”一词[43]，其灵感来自于主唱娜塔莉·缅因与丈夫演员阿德里安·帕斯达尔（Adrian Pasdar）离婚[44]。

039. 社会学家佩奇·斯威特（Paige Sweet）在社会不平等和举足轻重的家庭暴力亲密关系背景下研究煤气灯效应认为，“这种策略是性别化的，因为它们依赖于女性气质与非理性的联系。”[26]。
根据哲学教授凯特·艾布拉姆森（Kate Abramson）的观点，煤气灯效应的行为与性别歧视并没有特别的联系，尽管与男性相比，女性往往更经常成为受煤气灯效应影响的对象[3]。艾布拉姆森对此解释认为，这是社会条件的结果，并说：“这是性别歧视结构的一部分，认为女性比男性更没自信，对我们自身所抱持的观点、信念、反应和看法的怀疑程度要高于男性。而煤气灯效应旨在破坏某人的观点、信念、反应和看法。各种形式自我怀疑的性别歧视规范导致我们更易于出现此情形。”艾布拉姆森说，煤气灯效应的最后“阶段”是严重的临床抑郁症。哲学教授希尔德·林德曼（Hilde Lindemann）特别在谈及妇女时表示，在这种情况下，受害者抵抗操纵的能力取决于“她相信自身判断的能力”，建立心理认知的“对抗区”可以帮助受害者重新获得“普通水平的自由性”[27]。

政治事务[编辑]
专栏作家莫琳·道德（Maureen Dowd）是最早在政治背景下使用该术语的人之一[28]，她描述比尔·克林顿政府使用这项技术使纽特·金里奇受到小侮辱的意图，目的是激怒他向公众提出“歇斯底里”的投诉[29][30]。 
心理学家布莱恩特·韦尔奇（Bryant Welch）在其2008年的《混乱状态：政治操纵与对美国思想的攻击》一书中，描述该技术在现代传播时代开始在美国政治中的普遍性。 
记者弗里达·吉蒂斯（Frida Ghitis）用“点燃汽油”一词形容俄罗斯的全球关系。在俄罗斯特工活跃在克里米亚的同时，俄罗斯官员不断否认相关人员的存在，并操纵对政治团体的不信任来支持他们。[31]
《纽约时报杂志》，BBC和《青少年时尚》杂志的记者以及心理学家布莱恩特·韦尔奇、罗伯特·费尔德曼和莉亚·麦克艾拉斯都描述唐纳德·特朗普在2016年美国总统大选期间的某些行为以及他担任总统期间的举动[29][32][33][34][35]。新闻学教授本·雅格达（Ben Yagoda）在2017年1月《高等教育纪事报》中写道，由于特朗普的举动，“加油”一词再次成为热门话题，他说特朗普的“习惯性倾向说‘X’，接着在往后的某个日子里愤愤不平。”并声明“我没有说‘X’。实际上，我永远也不会梦想说‘X’”，为该术语带来新的注解[28]。
此外，宗派团体的领导者和追随者利用煤气灯效应以确保整合任何可能偏离团体的成员[36]。

工作职场[编辑]
当人们做的事情导致同事对自己及其行为提出质疑，而这对当事人的职业表现评价有所损害时，便会在工作场所引起人们关注[37]；受害者在此情境中可能被排除在任职场域的讨论外，成为他人讨论的流言蜚语，长期受到抹黑或质疑导致其信心遭破坏，施害者可能会将相关谈话转移到感知到的错误上[38]。任何人都可以操纵煤气灯效应，当施害者拥有权力时将特别有害[39]。

流行文化[编辑]
流行乐队Steely Dan在其2000年发行的专辑“ Two Against Nature ”中演唱一首名为“ Gaslighting Abbie”的歌曲。
2016年的神秘和心理惊悚片《列车上的女孩》（The Girl on the Train）探索了乘汽油对主角雷切尔（Rachel）的直接影响[29]，曾身为暴力虐待者的瑞秋前夫汤姆是受害者。雷切尔患有严重的抑郁症并且会酗酒，当蕾切尔喝醉时，他总是告诉瑞秋，她做了一些她不记得的可怕事情[40]。 
煤气灯效应是英国广播公司广播电视剧《弓箭手》中2016年情节的主题。这个故事描述海伦·阿切尔（Helen Archer）的伴侣和后来的丈夫罗布·蒂切纳（Rob Titchener）在两年期间对他们的情感虐待，引起公众对该现象的广泛讨论[41]。
在2018年的几个月中，煤气灯效应是NBC电视剧《我们的生活》中的主要情节。剧中角色加比·埃尔南德斯（Gabi Hernandez）在加比因谋杀阿比盖尔（Abigail）在该系列中所犯下的罪行而陷害后，向她最好的朋友阿比盖尔（Abigail Deveroux）放火[42]。 
2020年3月，Dixie Chicks发行一首名为“ Gaslighter ”的歌曲，这是他们即将发行的专辑Gaslighter的主打曲目，歌曲中提到“gaslighting”一词[43]，其灵感来自于主唱娜塔莉·缅因与丈夫演员阿德里安·帕斯达尔（Adrian Pasdar）离婚[44]。

《纽约时报杂志》，BBC和《青少年时尚》杂志的记者以及心理学家布莱恩特·韦尔奇、罗伯特·费尔德曼和莉亚·麦克艾拉斯都描述唐纳德·特朗普在2016年美国总统大选期间的某些行为以及他担任总统期间的举动[29][32][33][34][35]。新闻学教授本·雅格达（Ben Yagoda）在2017年1月《高等教育纪事报》中写道，由于特朗普的举动，“加油”一词再次成为热门话题，他说特朗普的“习惯性倾向说‘X’，接着在往后的某个日子里愤愤不平。”并声明“我没有说‘X’。实际上，我永远也不会梦想说‘X’”，为该术语带来新的注解[28]。
此外，宗派团体的领导者和追随者利用煤气灯效应以确保整合任何可能偏离团体的成员[36]。

工作职场[编辑]
当人们做的事情导致同事对自己及其行为提出质疑，而这对当事人的职业表现评价有所损害时，便会在工作场所引起人们关注[37]；受害者在此情境中可能被排除在任职场域的讨论外，成为他人讨论的流言蜚语，长期受到抹黑或质疑导致其信心遭破坏，施害者可能会将相关谈话转移到感知到的错误上[38]。任何人都可以操纵煤气灯效应，当施害者拥有权力时将特别有害[39]。

流行文化[编辑]

043. 心理学家布莱恩特·韦尔奇（Bryant Welch）在其2008年的《混乱状态：政治操纵与对美国思想的攻击》一书中，描述该技术在现代传播时代开始在美国政治中的普遍性。 
记者弗里达·吉蒂斯（Frida Ghitis）用“点燃汽油”一词形容俄罗斯的全球关系。在俄罗斯特工活跃在克里米亚的同时，俄罗斯官员不断否认相关人员的存在，并操纵对政治团体的不信任来支持他们。[31]
《纽约时报杂志》，BBC和《青少年时尚》杂志的记者以及心理学家布莱恩特·韦尔奇、罗伯特·费尔德曼和莉亚·麦克艾拉斯都描述唐纳德·特朗普在2016年美国总统大选期间的某些行为以及他担任总统期间的举动[29][32][33][34][35]。新闻学教授本·雅格达（Ben Yagoda）在2017年1月《高等教育纪事报》中写道，由于特朗普的举动，“加油”一词再次成为热门话题，他说特朗普的“习惯性倾向说‘X’，接着在往后的某个日子里愤愤不平。”并声明“我没有说‘X’。实际上，我永远也不会梦想说‘X’”，为该术语带来新的注解[28]。
此外，宗派团体的领导者和追随者利用煤气灯效应以确保整合任何可能偏离团体的成员[36]。

工作职场[编辑]
当人们做的事情导致同事对自己及其行为提出质疑，而这对当事人的职业表现评价有所损害时，便会在工作场所引起人们关注[37]；受害者在此情境中可能被排除在任职场域的讨论外，成为他人讨论的流言蜚语，长期受到抹黑或质疑导致其信心遭破坏，施害者可能会将相关谈话转移到感知到的错误上[38]。任何人都可以操纵煤气灯效应，当施害者拥有权力时将特别有害[39]。

流行文化[编辑]
流行乐队Steely Dan在其2000年发行的专辑“ Two Against Nature ”中演唱一首名为“ Gaslighting Abbie”的歌曲。
2016年的神秘和心理惊悚片《列车上的女孩》（The Girl on the Train）探索了乘汽油对主角雷切尔（Rachel）的直接影响[29]，曾身为暴力虐待者的瑞秋前夫汤姆是受害者。雷切尔患有严重的抑郁症并且会酗酒，当蕾切尔喝醉时，他总是告诉瑞秋，她做了一些她不记得的可怕事情[40]。 
煤气灯效应是英国广播公司广播电视剧《弓箭手》中2016年情节的主题。这个故事描述海伦·阿切尔（Helen Archer）的伴侣和后来的丈夫罗布·蒂切纳（Rob Titchener）在两年期间对他们的情感虐待，引起公众对该现象的广泛讨论[41]。
在2018年的几个月中，煤气灯效应是NBC电视剧《我们的生活》中的主要情节。剧中角色加比·埃尔南德斯（Gabi Hernandez）在加比因谋杀阿比盖尔（Abigail）在该系列中所犯下的罪行而陷害后，向她最好的朋友阿比盖尔（Abigail Deveroux）放火[42]。 
2020年3月，Dixie Chicks发行一首名为“ Gaslighter ”的歌曲，这是他们即将发行的专辑Gaslighter的主打曲目，歌曲中提到“gaslighting”一词[43]，其灵感来自于主唱娜塔莉·缅因与丈夫演员阿德里安·帕斯达尔（Adrian Pasdar）离婚[44]。

044. 记者弗里达·吉蒂斯（Frida Ghitis）用“点燃汽油”一词形容俄罗斯的全球关系。在俄罗斯特工活跃在克里米亚的同时，俄罗斯官员不断否认相关人员的存在，并操纵对政治团体的不信任来支持他们。[31]
《纽约时报杂志》，BBC和《青少年时尚》杂志的记者以及心理学家布莱恩特·韦尔奇、罗伯特·费尔德曼和莉亚·麦克艾拉斯都描述唐纳德·特朗普在2016年美国总统大选期间的某些行为以及他担任总统期间的举动[29][32][33][34][35]。新闻学教授本·雅格达（Ben Yagoda）在2017年1月《高等教育纪事报》中写道，由于特朗普的举动，“加油”一词再次成为热门话题，他说特朗普的“习惯性倾向说‘X’，接着在往后的某个日子里愤愤不平。”并声明“我没有说‘X’。实际上，我永远也不会梦想说‘X’”，为该术语带来新的注解[28]。
此外，宗派团体的领导者和追随者利用煤气灯效应以确保整合任何可能偏离团体的成员[36]。

工作职场[编辑]
当人们做的事情导致同事对自己及其行为提出质疑，而这对当事人的职业表现评价有所损害时，便会在工作场所引起人们关注[37]；受害者在此情境中可能被排除在任职场域的讨论外，成为他人讨论的流言蜚语，长期受到抹黑或质疑导致其信心遭破坏，施害者可能会将相关谈话转移到感知到的错误上[38]。任何人都可以操纵煤气灯效应，当施害者拥有权力时将特别有害[39]。

流行文化[编辑]
流行乐队Steely Dan在其2000年发行的专辑“ Two Against Nature ”中演唱一首名为“ Gaslighting Abbie”的歌曲。
2016年的神秘和心理惊悚片《列车上的女孩》（The Girl on the Train）探索了乘汽油对主角雷切尔（Rachel）的直接影响[29]，曾身为暴力虐待者的瑞秋前夫汤姆是受害者。雷切尔患有严重的抑郁症并且会酗酒，当蕾切尔喝醉时，他总是告诉瑞秋，她做了一些她不记得的可怕事情[40]。 
煤气灯效应是英国广播公司广播电视剧《弓箭手》中2016年情节的主题。这个故事描述海伦·阿切尔（Helen Archer）的伴侣和后来的丈夫罗布·蒂切纳（Rob Titchener）在两年期间对他们的情感虐待，引起公众对该现象的广泛讨论[41]。
在2018年的几个月中，煤气灯效应是NBC电视剧《我们的生活》中的主要情节。剧中角色加比·埃尔南德斯（Gabi Hernandez）在加比因谋杀阿比盖尔（Abigail）在该系列中所犯下的罪行而陷害后，向她最好的朋友阿比盖尔（Abigail Deveroux）放火[42]。 
2020年3月，Dixie Chicks发行一首名为“ Gaslighter ”的歌曲，这是他们即将发行的专辑Gaslighter的主打曲目，歌曲中提到“gaslighting”一词[43]，其灵感来自于主唱娜塔莉·缅因与丈夫演员阿德里安·帕斯达尔（Adrian Pasdar）离婚[44]。

045. 《纽约时报杂志》，BBC和《青少年时尚》杂志的记者以及心理学家布莱恩特·韦尔奇、罗伯特·费尔德曼和莉亚·麦克艾拉斯都描述唐纳德·特朗普在2016年美国总统大选期间的某些行为以及他担任总统期间的举动[29][32][33][34][35]。新闻学教授本·雅格达（Ben Yagoda）在2017年1月《高等教育纪事报》中写道，由于特朗普的举动，“加油”一词再次成为热门话题，他说特朗普的“习惯性倾向说‘X’，接着在往后的某个日子里愤愤不平。”并声明“我没有说‘X’。实际上，我永远也不会梦想说‘X’”，为该术语带来新的注解[28]。
此外，宗派团体的领导者和追随者利用煤气灯效应以确保整合任何可能偏离团体的成员[36]。

工作职场[编辑]
当人们做的事情导致同事对自己及其行为提出质疑，而这对当事人的职业表现评价有所损害时，便会在工作场所引起人们关注[37]；受害者在此情境中可能被排除在任职场域的讨论外，成为他人讨论的流言蜚语，长期受到抹黑或质疑导致其信心遭破坏，施害者可能会将相关谈话转移到感知到的错误上[38]。任何人都可以操纵煤气灯效应，当施害者拥有权力时将特别有害[39]。

流行文化[编辑]
流行乐队Steely Dan在其2000年发行的专辑“ Two Against Nature ”中演唱一首名为“ Gaslighting Abbie”的歌曲。
2016年的神秘和心理惊悚片《列车上的女孩》（The Girl on the Train）探索了乘汽油对主角雷切尔（Rachel）的直接影响[29]，曾身为暴力虐待者的瑞秋前夫汤姆是受害者。雷切尔患有严重的抑郁症并且会酗酒，当蕾切尔喝醉时，他总是告诉瑞秋，她做了一些她不记得的可怕事情[40]。 
煤气灯效应是英国广播公司广播电视剧《弓箭手》中2016年情节的主题。这个故事描述海伦·阿切尔（Helen Archer）的伴侣和后来的丈夫罗布·蒂切纳（Rob Titchener）在两年期间对他们的情感虐待，引起公众对该现象的广泛讨论[41]。
在2018年的几个月中，煤气灯效应是NBC电视剧《我们的生活》中的主要情节。剧中角色加比·埃尔南德斯（Gabi Hernandez）在加比因谋杀阿比盖尔（Abigail）在该系列中所犯下的罪行而陷害后，向她最好的朋友阿比盖尔（Abigail Deveroux）放火[42]。 
2020年3月，Dixie Chicks发行一首名为“ Gaslighter ”的歌曲，这是他们即将发行的专辑Gaslighter的主打曲目，歌曲中提到“gaslighting”一词[43]，其灵感来自于主唱娜塔莉·缅因与丈夫演员阿德里安·帕斯达尔（Adrian Pasdar）离婚[44]。

046. 此外，宗派团体的领导者和追随者利用煤气灯效应以确保整合任何可能偏离团体的成员[36]。

047. 工作职场

048. 当人们做的事情导致同事对自己及其行为提出质疑，而这对当事人的职业表现评价有所损害时，便会在工作场所引起人们关注[37]；受害者在此情境中可能被排除在任职场域的讨论外，成为他人讨论的流言蜚语，长期受到抹黑或质疑导致其信心遭破坏，施害者可能会将相关谈话转移到感知到的错误上[38]。任何人都可以操纵煤气灯效应，当施害者拥有权力时将特别有害[39]。

049. 流行文化

050. 流行乐队Steely Dan在其2000年发行的专辑“ Two Against Nature ”中演唱一首名为“ Gaslighting Abbie”的歌曲。
2016年的神秘和心理惊悚片《列车上的女孩》（The Girl on the Train）探索了乘汽油对主角雷切尔（Rachel）的直接影响[29]，曾身为暴力虐待者的瑞秋前夫汤姆是受害者。雷切尔患有严重的抑郁症并且会酗酒，当蕾切尔喝醉时，他总是告诉瑞秋，她做了一些她不记得的可怕事情[40]。 
煤气灯效应是英国广播公司广播电视剧《弓箭手》中2016年情节的主题。这个故事描述海伦·阿切尔（Helen Archer）的伴侣和后来的丈夫罗布·蒂切纳（Rob Titchener）在两年期间对他们的情感虐待，引起公众对该现象的广泛讨论[41]。
在2018年的几个月中，煤气灯效应是NBC电视剧《我们的生活》中的主要情节。剧中角色加比·埃尔南德斯（Gabi Hernandez）在加比因谋杀阿比盖尔（Abigail）在该系列中所犯下的罪行而陷害后，向她最好的朋友阿比盖尔（Abigail Deveroux）放火[42]。 
2020年3月，Dixie Chicks发行一首名为“ Gaslighter ”的歌曲，这是他们即将发行的专辑Gaslighter的主打曲目，歌曲中提到“gaslighting”一词[43]，其灵感来自于主唱娜塔莉·缅因与丈夫演员阿德里安·帕斯达尔（Adrian Pasdar）离婚[44]。

052. 煤气灯效应是英国广播公司广播电视剧《弓箭手》中2016年情节的主题。这个故事描述海伦·阿切尔（Helen Archer）的伴侣和后来的丈夫罗布·蒂切纳（Rob Titchener）在两年期间对他们的情感虐待，引起公众对该现象的广泛讨论[41]。
在2018年的几个月中，煤气灯效应是NBC电视剧《我们的生活》中的主要情节。剧中角色加比·埃尔南德斯（Gabi Hernandez）在加比因谋杀阿比盖尔（Abigail）在该系列中所犯下的罪行而陷害后，向她最好的朋友阿比盖尔（Abigail Deveroux）放火[42]。 
2020年3月，Dixie Chicks发行一首名为“ Gaslighter ”的歌曲，这是他们即将发行的专辑Gaslighter的主打曲目，歌曲中提到“gaslighting”一词[43]，其灵感来自于主唱娜塔莉·缅因与丈夫演员阿德里安·帕斯达尔（Adrian Pasdar）离婚[44]。

053. 在2018年的几个月中，煤气灯效应是NBC电视剧《我们的生活》中的主要情节。剧中角色加比·埃尔南德斯（Gabi Hernandez）在加比因谋杀阿比盖尔（Abigail）在该系列中所犯下的罪行而陷害后，向她最好的朋友阿比盖尔（Abigail Deveroux）放火[42]。 
2020年3月，Dixie Chicks发行一首名为“ Gaslighter ”的歌曲，这是他们即将发行的专辑Gaslighter的主打曲目，歌曲中提到“gaslighting”一词[43]，其灵感来自于主唱娜塔莉·缅因与丈夫演员阿德里安·帕斯达尔（Adrian Pasdar）离婚[44]。

001. 【标题】爱情轰炸 - 维基百科 --- Love bombing - Wikipedia

002. Love bombing is an attempt to influence a person by demonstrations of attention and affection. It can be used in different ways and for either positive or negative purposes.[1] Psychologists have identified love bombing as a possible part of a cycle of abuse and have warned against it. It has also been described as psychological manipulation in order to create a feeling of unity within a group against a society perceived as hostile.[2] In 2011, clinical psychologist Oliver James advocated love bombing in his book Love Bombing: Reset Your Child's Emotional Thermostat, as a means for parents to rectify emotional problems in their children.[3]爱情轰炸是一种试图通过表现出关注和感情来影响一个人。它可以以不同的方式使用，用于积极或消极的目的。[1] 心理学家已经确定爱情轰炸可能是虐待循环的一部分，并警告不要这样做。它也被描述为心理纵 ，以便在群体内营造一种团结感，反对被视为敌对的社会。[2]2011 年， 临床心理学家奥利弗·詹姆斯在其著作 《爱情轰炸：重置孩子的情绪恒温器 》中提倡爱情轰炸，作为父母纠正孩子情绪问题的一种手段。[3]

003. Definition and analysis  定义与分析

004. The expression "love bombing" was coined by members of the Unification Church of the United States during the 1970s[4] and was also used by members of the Family International (previously known as Children of God).[5][6] Psychology professor Margaret Singer reported on the concept.[1] In her 1996 book, Cults in Our Midst, she writes:
“爱情轰炸”一词是由美国统一教会成员在 1970 年代创造的[4]，也被国际家庭 （以前称为上帝之子） 的成员使用。[5] [6] 心理学教授玛格丽特·辛格报道了这个概念。[1] 在她 1996 年出版的《 我们中间的邪教 》一书中，她写道：

005. As soon as any interest is shown by the recruits, they may be love bombed by the recruiter or other cult members. This process of feigning friendship and interest in the recruit was originally associated with one of the early youth cults, but soon it was taken up by a number of groups as part of their program for luring people in. Love bombing is a coordinated effort, usually under the direction of leadership, that involves long-term members' flooding recruits and newer members with flattery, verbal seduction, affectionate but usually nonsexual touching, and lots of attention to their every remark. Love bombing—or the offer of instant companionship—is a deceptive ploy accounting for many successful recruitment drives.[7]一旦新兵表现出任何兴趣，他们就可能受到招募人员或其他邪教成员的爱情轰炸 。这种假装对新兵的友谊和兴趣的过程最初与早期的青年邪教之一有关，但很快它就被许多团体作为他们引诱人们的计划的一部分。爱情轰炸是一种协调一致的努力，通常在领导的指导下，涉及长期成员的奉承 、口头诱惑、深情但通常非性接触以及对他们的每一句话的大量关注。爱情轰炸——或即时陪伴的提议——是一种欺骗性策略，导致许多成功的招聘活动。[7]

006. Abusive relationships  虐待关系

007. Modern social media can intensify the effect of love bombing since it gives the abuser nearly constant contact and communication with the victim.[8] One of the signs of love bombing in the start of a relationship is intense attention during a short period of time and pressure for very rapid commitment.[9]现代社交媒体可以加剧爱情轰炸的影响，因为它使施虐者与受害者几乎持续不断地接触和沟通。[8] 一段关系开始时爱情轰炸的迹象之一是在短时间内受到强烈关注，并有非常迅速的承诺的压力。[9]
Psychiatrist Dale Archer identifies the phases of love bombing with the acronym IDD: "Intense Idealization, Devaluation, Discard (Repeat)", and the process of identifying this behavior pattern as SLL: "Stop, Look, and Listen", after which breaking off contact with the abuser can become more possible by also seeking support from family and friends.[8]精神病学家戴尔·阿切尔 （Dale Archer） 用首字母缩略词 IDD 来识别爱情轰炸的阶段：“强烈的理想化、贬值、 丢弃（重复）”，并将这种行为模式识别为 SLL：“停下来、看着和倾听”，之后通过寻求家人和朋友的支持，可以更有可能与施虐者断绝联系。[8]
Another sign of love bombing is being intensely showered with affection, gifts, and promises for the future with the predator so that the victim feels or is made to believe that all this is a sign of "love at first sight". Since such signs of affection and affirmation may meet felt needs and not look harmful at the surface, the excitement of such a new relationship often does not appear as cause for alarm.[9] However, after the initial excitement, when the victim shows interest or care about anything beyond their new partner, the manipulator may show anger or passive-aggressive behavior, or accuse the victims of selfishness. If the victim does not comply with demands, the devaluation stage begins: the abuser withdraws all affection or positive reinforcement and instead punishes the victim with whatever they feel is appropriate—shouting, beratement, mind games, silent treatment, or even physical abuse.[9][10]爱情轰炸的另一个迹象是与掠夺者被强烈的感情、礼物和对未来的承诺倾注，使受害者感到或被迫相信这一切都是“ 一见钟情 ”的标志。由于这种感情和肯定的迹象可能满足感觉需求，并且表面上看起来不会有害，因此这种新关系的兴奋通常不会引起恐慌。[9] 然而，在最初的兴奋之后，当受害者对新伴侣以外的任何事情表现出兴趣或关心时，纵者可能会表现出愤怒或被动攻击行为 ，或指责受害者自私。如果受害者不遵守要求，贬值阶段就开始了：施虐者撤回所有感情或积极强化 ，转而用他们认为合适的任何方式惩罚受害者——大喊大叫、斥责、 心理游戏 、 沉默对待 ，甚至身体虐待 。[9][10]
The expression has been used to describe the tactics used by pimps and gang members to control their victims.[11]这个表达方式被用来描述皮条客和帮派成员用来控制受害者的策略。[11]

Benign occurrences  良性事件[edit]
Excessive attention and affection does not constitute love bombing if there is no intent or pattern of further abuse. Archer explains: 
如果没有进一步虐待的意图或模式，那么过度的关注和关爱并不构成爱情轰炸。阿切尔解释说：
The key to understanding how love bombing differs from romantic courtship is to look at what happens next, after two people are officially a couple. If extravagant displays of affection continue indefinitely, if actions match words, and there is no devaluation phase, then it's probably not love bombing. That much attention might get annoying after a while, but it’s not unhealthy in and of itself.[8]理解爱情轰炸与浪漫求爱有何不同的关键是看看两个人正式成为情侣后接下来会发生什么。如果奢侈的爱意展示无限期地持续下去，如果行动与言语相符，并且没有贬值阶段，那么这可能不是爱情轰炸。一段时间后，那么多的关注可能会变得烦人，但它本身并不是不健康的。[8]
British author and psychologist Oliver James recommended love bombing as a technique for parents to help their troubled children. He described it as, "dedicating one-on-one time spoiling and lavishing your child with love, and, within reason, pandering to their every wish."[12][13] In 2011 Heidi Scrimgeour, a reporter for The Daily Express, tried the technique with her son and reported:
英国作家和心理学家奥利弗·詹姆斯推荐爱情轰炸作为父母帮助陷入困境的孩子的一种技巧。他将其描述为“用一对一的时间宠爱和慷慨地爱你的孩子，并在合理范围内迎合他们的每一个愿望。[12] [13] 2011 年，《 每日快报》 的记者海蒂·斯克林杰 （Heidi Scrimgeour） 与她的儿子一起尝试了这项技术，并报道说：
It's not rocket science that showering a child with affection will impact positively on their behaviour but what surprised me was how much my behaviour changed. Love bombing enabled me to see my child through a fresh lens, my disposition towards him softened and he seemed to bask in the glow of positive attention.[14]向孩子表达爱意会对他们的行为产生积极影响并不是火箭科学，但令我惊讶的是我的行为发生了如此大的变化。爱情轰炸使我能够通过一个全新的视角看待我的孩子，我对他的态度变得软化，他似乎沐浴在积极关注的光芒中。[14]

010. The expression has been used to describe the tactics used by pimps and gang members to control their victims.[11]这个表达方式被用来描述皮条客和帮派成员用来控制受害者的策略。[11]

011. Benign occurrences  良性事件

012. Excessive attention and affection does not constitute love bombing if there is no intent or pattern of further abuse. Archer explains: 
如果没有进一步虐待的意图或模式，那么过度的关注和关爱并不构成爱情轰炸。阿切尔解释说：

013. The key to understanding how love bombing differs from romantic courtship is to look at what happens next, after two people are officially a couple. If extravagant displays of affection continue indefinitely, if actions match words, and there is no devaluation phase, then it's probably not love bombing. That much attention might get annoying after a while, but it’s not unhealthy in and of itself.[8]理解爱情轰炸与浪漫求爱有何不同的关键是看看两个人正式成为情侣后接下来会发生什么。如果奢侈的爱意展示无限期地持续下去，如果行动与言语相符，并且没有贬值阶段，那么这可能不是爱情轰炸。一段时间后，那么多的关注可能会变得烦人，但它本身并不是不健康的。[8]

014. British author and psychologist Oliver James recommended love bombing as a technique for parents to help their troubled children. He described it as, "dedicating one-on-one time spoiling and lavishing your child with love, and, within reason, pandering to their every wish."[12][13] In 2011 Heidi Scrimgeour, a reporter for The Daily Express, tried the technique with her son and reported:
英国作家和心理学家奥利弗·詹姆斯推荐爱情轰炸作为父母帮助陷入困境的孩子的一种技巧。他将其描述为“用一对一的时间宠爱和慷慨地爱你的孩子，并在合理范围内迎合他们的每一个愿望。[12] [13] 2011 年，《 每日快报》 的记者海蒂·斯克林杰 （Heidi Scrimgeour） 与她的儿子一起尝试了这项技术，并报道说：

015. It's not rocket science that showering a child with affection will impact positively on their behaviour but what surprised me was how much my behaviour changed. Love bombing enabled me to see my child through a fresh lens, my disposition towards him softened and he seemed to bask in the glow of positive attention.[14]向孩子表达爱意会对他们的行为产生积极影响并不是火箭科学，但令我惊讶的是我的行为发生了如此大的变化。爱情轰炸使我能够通过一个全新的视角看待我的孩子，我对他的态度变得软化，他似乎沐浴在积极关注的光芒中。[14]
